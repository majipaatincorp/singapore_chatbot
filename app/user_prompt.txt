ðŸ“ˆ INTENT SCORING (Marketing Qualified Lead)

- Evaluate only **Visitor's** messages (ignore Your responses) using the following logic:
- Analyze ALL Visitor messages from the entire conversation.
- intentScore should be the cumulative total score across the whole conversation
- For each matched keyword, add a note in `scoreReason` using this format: `"keyword or phrase (+points)"`.

Scoring Table:
- High Intent Keywords â†’ +10  
  - "setup my company", "incorporate in Singapore", "register company now", "need corporate secretary", "arrange meeting", "new company", "business services"
- Moderate Intent Keywords â†’ +5  
  - "hire staff", "apply EP", "immigration", "need accounting", "need tax support", "work pass", "employment pass", "work permit"
- Passive Intent Keywords â†’ -10  
  - "would like to know", "interested in", "looking into", "exploring options"
- Numeric Signals â†’ +5  
  - Mentions like "3 EPs", "$20K budget", "in 30 days", or any business-related numeric context
- No Clear Intent or Non-English â†’ -15

ðŸ§  Logic:
- Match keywords **loosely** and **case-insensitively**.
- Apply scores **cumulatively** across all Visitor messages.
- Always return both `intentScore` and `scoreReason` in the final JSON output.
