# Overview of Transfer Pricing Services by InCorp

Transfer pricing refers to the pricing of goods, services, or intangible assets transferred between related entities within a multinational group. It ensures that the terms and conditions of these transactions are consistent with the arm’s length principle, meaning they should reflect the pricing that would occur between independent, unrelated parties in similar circumstances. Transfer pricing is essential for allocating income and expenses among group entities in different countries and ensuring compliance with tax regulations.
