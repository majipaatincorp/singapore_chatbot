# Company Registration

**What are the basic requirements to register a company in Singapore?**
To register a company in Singapore, you need at least one director who is a Singapore resident, a minimum of one shareholder, a local registered address, and an appointed company secretary. The minimum paid-up capital is S$1, though you can increase this amount later. All directors must be at least 18 years old and have no criminal record.

**How long does it take to register a company in Singapore?**
With all documents in order, company registration can be completed within 1-2 business days. However, certain business activities may require additional licenses or permits, which could extend the timeline. Our team can guide you through the specific requirements for your industry.

**Can foreigners own 100% of a Singapore company?**

# Tax Filing and Compliance

**What are the main tax filing requirements for Singapore companies?**
Singapore companies must file annual returns with ACRA, submit Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI) within 3 months from the financial year-end, and file corporate tax returns (Form C-S/C) by November 30th each year. Companies must also maintain proper accounting records and prepare financial statements.

**What is the corporate tax rate in Singapore?**
Singapore's corporate tax rate is 17% on chargeable income. However, there are various tax incentives available, including tax exemption schemes for new start-up companies and partial tax exemption for established companies on their first S$200,000 of chargeable income.

**How often do I need to file GST returns?**
If your company is GST-registered (mandatory when annual turnover exceeds S$1 million), you must file GST returns quarterly. The filing and payment are due within one month after the end of each quarter. Our team can assist with GST registration and compliance.

# Virtual Office Services/PEO/EOR/Payroll Services

**What services are included in a virtual office package?**

**How does Professional Employer Organization (PEO) service work in Singapore?**
PEO services allow companies to hire employees in Singapore without establishing a legal entity. The PEO becomes the legal employer of record, handling payroll, benefits administration, and HR compliance while you maintain day-to-day management of employees.

**What are the benefits of outsourcing payroll services?**
Outsourcing payroll ensures compliance with Singapore's employment laws, accurate CPF contributions, timely salary disbursement, and proper maintenance of payroll records. It reduces administrative burden and minimizes compliance risks while providing confidentiality in salary matters.

# Non-Resident Company Setup

**What are the options for foreign companies to establish a presence in Singapore?**
Foreign companies can establish a presence in Singapore through a subsidiary company, branch office, or representative office. Each structure has different requirements and implications for tax and liability.

No, you don't need to be physically present in Singapore to set up a company. The registration process can be handled remotely with proper documentation and authorized representatives. However, you'll need a local resident director.

**What is the difference between a Branch Office and a Subsidiary?**

**Which business structure offers the best liability protection?**
A Private Limited Company offers the best liability protection as it's a separate legal entity from its shareholders. Shareholders' liability is limited to their capital contribution, protecting personal assets from business debts and liabilities.
