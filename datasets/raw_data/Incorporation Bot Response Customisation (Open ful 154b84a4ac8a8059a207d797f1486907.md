**To set up a company in Singapore and relocate with your family, you will need to follow several steps:**

1. **Company Registration**: You must register your business with the Accounting & Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA).
2. **Work Passes**: As a foreign entrepreneur, you can apply for an EntrePass or ONE Pass, which allows you to operate your business in Singapore.
3. **Relocation**: For your family, you may need to apply for Dependant Passes or Long-Term Visit Passes, depending on your residency status and the type of work pass you obtain.
4. **Local Support**: Engaging a professional service provider like InCorp can help streamline the registration process and assist with the necessary paperwork for your relocation.
