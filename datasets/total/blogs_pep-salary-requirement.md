Singapore has various  work passes  for professionals, including the Personalised Employment Pass (PEP) which comes with a few flexible benefits. This is a visa tailored for top-tier professionals and managers, offering enhanced benefits over the Employment Pass (EP).

This article will provide a detailed overview of the PEP salary requirement, the application process, the documents required, and other benefits associated with it.

## What is Singapore’s Personalised Employment Pass?

The Singapore Personalised Employment Pass (PEP) is a specialised work visa that is not tied to a specific employer. It caters to highly qualified individuals seeking employment in Singapore and allows seamless job transitions without needing re-application. Additionally, it allows the PEP holder to stay in this country if unemployed for less than six months.

Therefore, PEP offers several key features, which include the following:

- A pass holder can hold a job in any sector without restriction. However, certain professions, such as medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, architecture, and law, require registration to practice in Singapore.
- A pass holder need not reapply for a pass when changing jobs, providing ease of transition.
- Stay in Singapore continuously for up to 6 months without employment to search for new opportunities.
- Eligible family members can also obtain passes.
- There is no requirement for a foreign worker levy or quota, simplifying administrative burdens for employers.

## What Are the Salary Requirements for a Personalised Employment Pass?

Applicants must meet specific salary criteria to be eligible for a Personalised Employment Pass (PEP).

- Local professionals require a fixed monthly salary of at least S$22,500, benchmarked to the top 10% of Employment Pass holders (EP).
- To meet the salary requirement, overseas foreign professionals must have had a last-drawn salary within the past six months of their application.

Besides, the individuals will not be eligible for PEP if they have the following.

- Employment Pass holders under the sponsorship scheme.
- Freelancers or foreigners intending to work on a freelance basis.
- An ACRA-registered company’s business owners include sole proprietors, partners, shareholders, or cases where a director is also a shareholder.
- Professionals in roles such as journalists, editors, sub-editors, or producers.

### Passes for Family

The PEP holders can apply for the respective passes for their family members below.

The required documents must be kept handy and application costs must be paid, which include S$105 per pass upon submission and S$225 per pass upon issuance. Besides, additional fees may apply for Multiple Journey Visas at S$30 each.

Below, we share the step-by-step process of the PEP application process.

- Step 1: The candidate or the candidate’s representative can apply.
- Step 2: If approved, the candidate will receive an in-principle approval letter (IPA) on the registered mail ID.
- Step 3: Once the IPA has been received, the candidate will have 6 months to enter Singapore and request to issue the PEP.

    - The candidate’s residential address in Singapore
    - The local address where the PEP card can be delivered
    - Contact details of at least one authorised recipient who can receive an SMS or email alert with delivery details
- Step 5: Upon issuance of the Personalised Employment Pass (PEP), the candidate receives a notification letter. It will remain valid for one month and grant the authorisation to work and travel freely in and out of Singapore during this period.
- Step 6: Register fingerprints and get the photo taken (if necessary)
- Step 7: After visiting the Employment Pass Services Centre (EPSC) for document verification, the candidate can expect to receive the card within four working days.

## Documents Required to Get Personalised Employment Pass (PEP)

If an applicant already possesses an Employment Pass, they need not resubmit copies of certain documents during the Personalised Employment Pass (PEP) application process. It includes:

- Candidate’s passport
- The name and address of the employer, if available.
- Details of the offer from the Singapore-based employer.

## How Do You Appeal Against a Rejected Personalised Employment Pass Application?

If a PEP application is rejected, an applicant has three months to appeal. However, be sure to know the reasons for rejection, and try to avoid mentioning those details again.

Applicants have a 3-month window following the rejection to submit an appeal using this form. Only the applicant or authorised employment agent, such as InCorp, can make enquiries or appeals. It will take 8 weeks to process.

## PEP Cancellation

There is also the option to cancel a Personalised Employment Pass. However, there are two conditions for cancelling a PEP. It includes:

- Unemployment for more than 6 months.
- Having left Singapore’s permanent residency – you must cancel the pass within 1 week from your departure date.

But before cancelling, you, as the employer, must seek your tax clearance from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) at least 1 month before your employee leaves the job.

A pass holder can cancel their Singapore Personalised Employment pass through two types of processes. These are as follows:

### Online Form

For this, the applicants or the agents must submit the online application form, which will take 2 weeks to process. Once the pass is cancelled, the applicants will get a Short-Term Visit Pass (STVP). It will grant them the right to stay in Singapore for 90 days from the application date.

### EP eService

For this, you have to follow the below-mentioned steps

- Log in to the EP eService portal using your credentials.
- Navigate to the option for pass cancellation.
- Fill out the necessary details, including the information and reason for cancellation related to Personalised Employment Pass holders.
- Specify that you are requesting an STVP for the pass holder.
- Submit the cancellation request.

## How to Replace Personalised Employment Pass?

If a pass card has been lost, stolen, or damaged, a pass holder must apply for a replacement within one week to avoid any complications. This can be done using either of these options:

- You can appoint an employment agent, such as InCorp, to submit your employee’s application form online
    - Log in to EP eService and provide the necessary information
    - Pay replacement fees via GIRO, Visa, Mastercard, or Amex
    - No refunds are permitted after request submission
    - If approved, the pass holder and the employment agent will receive a replacement card letter via email with collection instructions.

    - Schedule an appointment at EPSC for pass replacement.
    - Bring the necessary supporting documents to your appointment.
    - Pay fees using VISA, MasterCard, AMEX, NETS, or CashCard (if your credit/debit card is not issued in Singapore, ensure it’s activated for overseas transactions).
    - Receive a card replacement letter upon completion.

## Is There Any Limitation to the Singapore Personalised Employment Pass (PEP)?

The PEP comes with an array of limitations and inconveniences that are important to be mindful of. It includes the below:

- PEP has a high and fixed monthly salary requirement
- PEP holders facing job loss are granted a grace period of merely six months to secure alternative employment. Failure to secure a new job within this timeframe results in the cancellation of their PEP, necessitating their departure from Singapore.
- The PEP is initially valid for three years and is not renewable. PEP holders seeking to extend their stay beyond this period must obtain an Employment Pass (EP) or an S Pass.
- While PEP holders can bring their spouse and children to Singapore on a Dependant’s Pass, they must pay separate application fees and handle additional administrative tasks. Furthermore, there is no assurance that these supplementary applications will be approved.

## What to Do to Maintain a Singapore Personalised Employment Pass

Pass holders must ensure that their contact and employment information are up-to-date with MOM.  They can notify MOM via their official website that they want to change the information listed below.

- Any changes in the employment status.
- Change of local contact details
- Any changes in the fixed monthly salary or annual salary. This information needs to be declared within 30 days from the last day of the calendar year.

With their MyMOM Portal account, they can update the following information in their Personalised Employment Pass.
