Sustainability reporting, a type of non-financial reporting, is the practice of disclosing a company’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, using sustainability reporting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, has evolved into a hallmark of responsible corporate operations.

Similarly, the regulatory framework in Singapore has also been shifting towards prioritising ESG reporting. For example, the Environmental Protection and Management Act and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) listing rules encourage businesses to disclose their ESG performance, including strategy, risk management, and climate change targets. It has also provided recommendations to mandate climate-related disclosures for all large private and listed companies companies as part of its proactive approach towards environmental transparency and accountability.

Despite this paradigm shift, many businesses still see sustainability performance as a hindrance, despite the obvious opportunities to leverage it as a competitive advantage and for profit. This narrative transition from a climate ‘crisis’ to a climate ‘opportunity’ is not an exercise in corporate cynicism, but a pragmatic acknowledgement of the relationship between environmental stewardship and corporate profitability.

The burgeoning green economy is not some utopian concept; it is a tangible, profitable reality gradually unfolding across the global corporate landscape.

This article navigates through the urgency underpinning sustainability reporting in today’s global corporate landscape, particularly focusing on Singapore’s regulatory advancements, economic incentives, and the real-world implications it presents.

Through the lens of sustainability reporting, it explores how acknowledging the climate crisis and trying to combat the repercussions of climate change translates into seizing corporate opportunities and creating a win-win scenario for both the planet and profit margins over the long term.

## Urgency Through the Lens of the Climate Crisis

### The ‘Code Red’ Warning from IPCC and COP26 Commitments

The ‘Code Red’ warning in 2021 from the International Plant Protection Convention (IPCC) was a pivotal moment that underscored the dire need for climate action. This urgency was mirrored in the commitments made by political leaders during the COP26 summit.

The global consensus was clear: immediate and decisive action is indispensable to mitigate the destructive impacts of climate change. It is no longer a fringe opinion to be dismissed in corporate spheres, but a stark reality that the world’s largest carbon emitters must address.

### Progress and Gaps in Global Sustainability Reporting

While there has been progress in climate reporting among the world’s largest corporations, there’s still a substantial gap, especially in key areas of sustainability and ESG reporting. The disconnect between the urgency of climate action and the actual ‘hard results’ delivered by businesses is a concern that needs to be addressed.

### Disconnect Between Urgency and ‘Hard Results’

The aforementioned disconnect underscores a critical misalignment. While there’s a broad acknowledgement of the climate crisis, the tangible actions taken by many businesses fall short of the mark. This gap outlines the need for a more robust and transparent sustainability reporting framework that holds corporations accountable.

### Immediate Action as COP28 Approaches

As the globe heads towards COP28, the call for immediate action resonates louder, and there is a dire need to avert environmental and human tragedies escalating at an unsettling pace.

## Urgency Through the Lens of Embracing the Green Economy

### Emerging Green Economy

The green economy is flourishing, offering many opportunities for Singaporean enterprises. By aligning operations with global sustainability goals, companies can mitigate their environmental impact, demonstrate to investors how it influences sustainable development, and unlock new avenues of growth and innovation.

Sustainability reporting can, in fact, be a linchpin for companies to drive top-line growth and attract socially responsible investments. By showcasing a commitment to sustainability, companies can enhance their brand equity, foster customer loyalty, and tap into a growing pool of green-conscious investors.

### Economic Incentives and Challenges

#### Cost-saving Through Sustainability Reporting

A sustainability report can catalyse cost-saving and resource optimisation. By monitoring and reporting on energy, water use, and waste, companies can identify areas of excessive resource consumption and implement measures for more sustainable use, translating into significant cost savings.

#### Support Systems for SMEs

Support systems like the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) by Enterprise Singapore have been pivotal in aiding Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in overcoming challenges related to sustainability reporting. These initiatives provide the necessary financial and technical support, facilitating SMEs in navigating the sustainability reporting landscape.

### Real-world Implications and Opportunities

#### Case Studies

Transitioning towards a sustainable operational model is not just a theoretical concept but a pragmatic initiative that many companies in Singapore have embraced.

For instance, as consumers have become more educated and aware of the environmental impact of food production, they are increasingly interested in knowing where their food comes from and what it contains. In response, startups have found the demand for plant-based alternatives to food products.

Companies like Singapore-based Karana Foods make plant-based versions of traditional animal-based meat products such as chicken satay and beef rendang. The company uses jackfruit as a replacement for meat, as it has a similar texture when cooked.

To differentiate themselves further from other plant-based food companies, Karana uses natural whole food ingredients, rather than processed ingredients, to create their products. Doing so gives them a competitive edge as consumers become more interested in healthy and sustainable food options.

#### New Market Segments

By adhering to enhanced sustainability reporting standards, companies unlock doors to new market segments and investor bases. This is particularly relevant in a global marketplace that is increasingly valuing sustainability.

Companies that are transparent about their sustainability metrics will likely attract partnerships with like-minded businesses, gain access to green financing, and meet the evolving preferences of a green-conscious consumer base.

## Closing the Data Gap – Supporting Sustainability Reporting in Singapore

While Singaporean companies navigate the evolving landscape of sustainability reporting, innovative businesses like InterOpera, which operates its own sustainable commodity exchange, OperaX, offers much-needed assistance.

As a digital enterprise, it is capable of providing supporting green data and documents, such as detailed project information for carbon projects, to boost the reliability of sustainable commodities.

This key data can potentially support companies by enhancing accuracy, transparency, and credibility when creating sustainability reports, therefore also helping to fill information gaps and alleviate their challenges.

## Where to Next for Climate Reporting in Singapore

As international sustainability standards continue to progress and advance, Singaporean enterprises must stay up-to-date on these changes to remain competitive and compliant.

The urgency of addressing climate crises and capitalising on the green economy underscores the significance of robust sustainability reporting in Singapore. The twin narrative of environmental conservation and corporate opportunity presents a compelling case for companies to embrace sustainability reporting.

It aligns them with global sustainability goals and positions them favourably in a competitive market landscape that values transparency, innovation, and environmental stewardship.
