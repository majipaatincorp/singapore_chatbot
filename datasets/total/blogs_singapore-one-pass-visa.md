Singapore entices global talents with its blend of economic prospects, political stability, and modern amenities. The country’s cultural diversity, safety, and high living standards offer a vibrant setting for professional and personal advancement. Additionally, it is important for individuals to be aware of various immigration and visa programs

To enhance the country’s talent acquisition strategy, the Ministry of Manpower introduced the Overseas Networks &amp; Expertise Pass (ONE Pass). This initiative aims to attract top-tier global professionals, positioning Singapore as an attractive international hub for highly skilled talents.

This article is a comprehensive guide to the Singapore ONE Pass Visa, detailing its eligibility criteria, application steps, associated fees, validity period, renewal procedures, advantages, necessary documentation, and everything else essential for understanding this visa program.

## What is the ONE Pass Visa in Singapore?

To draw the attention of foreign talents, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) introduced the Overseas Networks and Expertise Pass (ONE Pass), effective 1 Jan 2023. This is an individualised work pass that is not tied to a specific employer. Consequently, if a pass holder opts to change jobs, they do not need to seek a new work pass again.

If you compare this pass with other work passes, including the Employment Pass (EP), EntrePass, and Personalised Employment Pass (PEP), you will see that the ONE Pass offers more flexibility.

For example, the ONE Pass enables its holders to simultaneously work for multiple companies in Singapore at any given time. However, Employment Pass (EP) holders do not have this flexibility as it allows them to work for only one employer.

### Validity of ONE Pass

The ONE Pass will remain valid for 5 years. After this 5-year validity period, the individual needs to renew ONE Pass. To qualify for renewal, the pass holder must meet one of the following criteria:

- Have earned a fixed monthly salary of at least S$30,000 on average over the past 5 years in Singapore.
- Have started and is operating a Singapore-based company that employs at least 5 locals, each earning a fixed monthly salary of at least S$5,000. This salary aligns with the minimum requirement for the Employment Pass (EP).

## Eligibility Criteria for One Pass

The individual applying for this personalised work pass must meet one of the following criteria:

- Have received a consistent monthly salary of at least S$30,000, or its equivalent in foreign currency, over the past 12 consecutive months.
- If you are applying from overseas, you must also demonstrate that a reputable overseas company has employed you for at least one year.
- Will be earning a fixed monthly salary of at least S$30,000 from a well-established company based in Singapore.

| Company A   | Company B   | Total Fixed Monthly Salary   | Eligibility   |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| S$20,000    | S$10,000    | S$30,000                     | No            |
| S$30,000    | S$5,000     | S$35,000                     | Yes           |
| S$30,000    | Nil         | S$30,000                     | Yes           |

### Qualifying through Outstanding Achievements

Besides, if you have not met the salary criteria, you still have the opportunity to apply for this pass for your exceptional accomplishments in any of the following areas:

- Sports
- Arts and Culture
- Academia and research

The MOM will thoroughly review your work history, achievements, and documents you submit before approving your application for ONE Pass.

## How Do You Apply for an Overseas Networks &amp; Expertise Pass?

To initiate the application process for a ONE Pass, either the candidate or a specialised agency acting on their behalf must complete the following steps.

### Application Submission

Either an individual or a specialised professional agency must complete the application form and pay the application fee. The process typically takes up to four weeks, though applications via the “Outstanding Achievements Route” may require extended assessment by relevant agencies.

### Get In-Principle Approval (IPA) Letter

Upon approval, you will receive the IPA letter. This letter serves as a pre-approved single-entry work visa allowing entry into Singapore. It grants a six-month window for entry and pass issuance. Additionally, it specifies whether a medical examination is required.

### Entry to Singapore

To enter Singapore, applicants must adhere to travel requirements, which may vary based on vaccination status.

### Request EPSC (Employment Pass Services Centre)

The applicant must schedule an appointment at the EPSC within six months of receiving the IPA. To obtain the ONE pass, they need to bring the following supporting documents at the time of appointment:

1. In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter.
2. Candidate’s original passport, email address, and local mobile number.
3. Candidate’s residential address in Singapore
4. Details of the candidate’s current Short-Term Visit Pass or immigration pass.
5. Completed Medical Declaration Form, if applicable.
6. Provide the local address for ONE Pass card delivery and the contact details of at least one authorised recipient to receive an SMS or email alert, if applicable.

### Get Notification Letter

The notification letter remains valid for one month, enabling the individual to work and travel in and out of Singapore during the ONE pass processing period. Furthermore, it specifies whether you must undergo fingerprint registration and photo capture.

### Register Your Fingerprints and Photos

New candidates and those who registered over five years ago must register fingerprints and upload photos within two weeks of ONE Pass issuance. They should schedule an appointment with the EPSC and bring the following documents:

- Original passport.
- Appointment letter.
- Notification letter.

### Receive One Pass

After the registration or document verification process, the candidate can expect to receive the card within five working days.

#### Application Costs

Upon application submission, each pass incurs a fee of S$105. Once the ONE pass is issued, the cost is S$225 per pass, and an additional S$30 is charged for each Multiple Journey Visa, if applicable.

### Documents Required for One Pass Application Process

All applications for the Overseas Networks &amp; Expertise Pass must include a passport page, inclusive of any amendments. If the candidate’s name in the passport differs from the name in other documents, the following additional documents must be uploaded:

- An explanation letter.
- Supporting documents, such as a deed poll.

### Additional Documents to be Submitted

1. For individuals who are already earning a fixed monthly salary of at least S$30,000 and have worked for a Singapore-based established company for at least a year , the following documents are required:
    - Monthly payslips covering a continuous 12-month period.
    - Latest tax statements from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore.
    - Documentation verifying additional income sources beyond the fixed monthly salary, if applicable.

## Appeal Against a Rejected ONE Pass Application

Individuals who have been unsuccessful in their application for the Overseas Networks &amp; Expertise Pass will have a window of 3 months to appeal, but only if they are aware of the reasons for the rejection. This is because submitting the same information in the appeal without addressing the reasons for rejection will not result in a different outcome.

Authorised employment agents must include a signed authorisation letter confirming that the person has permitted them to submit an appeal on their behalf.

Regarding processing time, most appeals are handled within 4 weeks. The outcome will be communicated to the email address specified in the original application form.

## Cancellation of Overseas Networks &amp; Expertise Pass

If you cease working in Singapore, you must cancel your Overseas Networks &amp; Expertise Pass at least 1 week before your departure date.

However, before cancelling, your prospective employer must request tax clearance from the IRAS at least 1 month prior to your job termination. If you are self-employed, you must fulfill your tax obligations at least 1 month before your anticipated departure date.

To cancel your pass, you have two options:

- Schedule an appointment to visit our Employment Pass Services Centre.
- Submit your cancellation request online.

If you are not departing Singapore immediately, you can request a Short-Term Visit Pass (STVP) when submitting your cancellation request. The STVP allows a stay of up to 89 days from the application date.

## Is It Possible to Replace a ONE Pass?

Yes, if your pass card is lost, damaged, or stolen, you must apply for a new one within 1 week of the incident. For this, you have to follow the below-mentioned process:

- Schedule an appointment at our Employment Pass Services Centre (EPSC).
- Bring your original passport for the appointment. Along with this, you have to produce
    - Damaged card, if your card is damaged.
    - If it was stolen, bring the police report.
- Pay the applicable fees (non-refundable) using Visa, Mastercard, Amex, NETS, or CashCard. Ensure your credit or debit card, if issued outside Singapore, is activated for overseas use.
    - For a damaged card: S$60.
    - For a lost card, the fee is S$100 for the first loss, S$300 for a subsequent loss.
- Once your replacement card request is approved, you can collect your card after 4 working days.

## Benefits of Having a ONE Pass

The introduction of the Singapore ONE Pass visa heralds a significant advancement in immigration policy, offering a multitude of benefits to eligible individuals. It includes the following:

- ONE Pass holder gains the right to establish a company in Singapore, albeit subject to certain conditions. So, it fosters entrepreneurial endeavours and facilitates business growth within the country.
- The pass extends unprecedented employment flexibility, allowing ONE Pass holders to engage with multiple companies concurrently. This flexibility empowers individuals to diversify their professional engagements and maximise their potential contributions to Singapore’s economy.
- The ONE Pass extends privileges to family members, enabling them to join the pass holder in Singapore. This provision enhances social cohesion and supports familial bonds, contributing to the well-being and integration of expatriates in Singaporean society.
- Notably, the absence of the COMPASS assessment system streamlines the application process for pass holders, eliminating bureaucratic hurdles and expediting entry into the workforce.
- Similarly, employers seeking to hire ONE Pass holders benefit from exemptions under the Fair Consideration Framework, simplifying recruitment procedures and encouraging the employment of skilled professionals.
- The ONE Pass acknowledges the importance of spousal employment, granting spouses the right to work under a Letter of Consent. This provision promotes inclusivity and leverages the talents and capabilities of accompanying spouses, enriching the labour market with diverse skill sets.

Overall, the Singapore ONE Pass represents a progressive approach to immigration policy, aligning with the nation’s objectives. It includes fostering innovation, economic growth and social cohesion which offers unparalleled opportunities for skilled individuals and their families to thrive in the dynamic landscape of the country.

## FAQs About Singapore ONE Pass

- How do I qualify for ONE Pass in Singapore?
- Whether you qualify for an Overseas Networks and Expertise Pass depends on the route you choose to apply through. There are two routes available: Each route has its own set of qualification requirements that you must meet to be eligible for the pass.
    - ONE Pass route based on a salary criterion.
    - ONE Pass route based on outstanding achievements.

- Can my ONE Pass be revoked?
- Yes, the ONE Pass can be revoked. If the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) determines that you do not contribute significantly to the economy, your pass may be revoked. Consequently, you may not be able to stay in Singapore, which could impact your stability, particularly if you have dependents.

- The Letter of Consent (LOC) is a visa benefit specifically granted to the spouse of a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident (PR). It allows them to work in this country without going through the rigorous process of applying for a work pass. This serves as an additional perk for the spouse of a ONE Pass holder to obtain work privileges.
