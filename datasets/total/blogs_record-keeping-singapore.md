In the modern business landscape, the importance of meticulous record-keeping cannot be overstated. It is the backbone of financial health, legal compliance, and strategic decision-making.

Effective business record management safeguards against potential audits or legal issues and provides invaluable insights into your company’s operations, helping to streamline processes and improve overall efficiency.

From tracking expenses and managing invoices to, the practices you put in place for handling your business records can significantly impact your organisation’s success.

As we delve deeper into this topic, we will explore the benefits of strategic record-keeping strategies and share practical tips for ensuring your records are accurate, accessible, and secure.

## What is Record Keeping?

Record keeping is the systematic process of collecting, organising, storing, and maintaining accurate financial documents that reflect a company’s transactions, activities, and operations. These business records include invoices, receipts, vouchers, bank statements, and other supporting documents essential for legal compliance and tax reporting.

## What Are the Benefits of Record Keeping?

There are several prominent advantages of maintaining accurate and thorough records for a business in Singapore. We explore them below:

### Make Better Business Decisions

Accurate and reliable record-keeping provides a clear overview of the financial health of your business. With updated company records, you can easily track your income, expenses, and cash flow. This information is crucial in making informed decisions about budgeting, investing, and managing resources effectively.

### Awareness of Company’s Financial Status

By regularly keeping track of your company’s financial records, you can have a clear understanding of its current financial status. This includes your profits, losses, expenses, and cash flow.

With this information, you can identify areas where you may need to cut costs or increase revenue. Additionally, having a thorough understanding of your finances can help you make more informed decisions when it comes to budgeting and resource allocation.

### Stay Compliant and Avoid Penalties

Companies that maintain proper record-keeping in accordance with local legislation can avoid incurring penalties such as a fine or jail term.

### Facilitate Tax Reporting and Audits

Accurate record-keeping also makes it easier for businesses to report their taxes and undergo audits by tax authorities. By having all financial documents properly organised and stored, companies can easily provide the necessary information and evidence to support their tax filings. This reduces the risk of facing penalties or additional taxes due to incorrect reporting.

## What Are the IRAS Record-Keeping Requirements?

The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) mandates that companies must keep records for a minimum of 5 years from the relevant Year of Assessment (YA).

It must retain records such as bank statements and source documents to explain transactions related to its income, purchases, and business expenses. Accounting records and schedules summarising business transactions must also be kept systematically.

Note that GST-registered businesses must also maintain proper business and accounting records for at least 5 years to support their GST declarations.

Companies that are unable to provide sufficient documents to support their input tax claim will have their claims disallowed. Penalties may also be imposed.

Here is a record-keeping checklist that is useful for business owners:

A company that fails to comply with record-keeping requirements is considered offending under the Singapore Income Tax Act 1947 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1993. IRAS may proceed to:

1. Use its best judgment to determine the revenue earned
2. Disallow expense claims, capital allowances of GST input tax claims, where applicable, and/or
3. Impose financial penalties of up to S$5,500, and if payment is defaulted upon, imprisonment of up to 6 months

## How to Achieve Good Record Keeping Practices

There are a few methods that companies in Singapore can adopt to maintain proper record-keeping successfully. They are:

### Use the Right Accounting Software

It is crucial to use accounting software that supports proper record keeping. Companies are encouraged to use software listed on IRAS’ Accounting Software Register Plus (ASR+).
