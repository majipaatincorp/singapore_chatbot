# Relooking Sustainability After COVID-19

<!-- image -->

We  have learned to live with COVID-19 as it shifts from a pandemic to an endemic  situation today.

One aspect that this blog article  looks at today is how we can relook at sustainability after COVID-19.

The virus has accelerated the adoption of sustainability in the workplace. However, the growth of a green  economy is in the hands of both corporations and our consumers.

It has brought a lot of things into  perspective, and when asked, 56% of people (and corporations) showed interest in  lowering their carbon footprint and daily  plastic use.

New sustainable and agile startups  are now leading the way, leading big conglomerates to follow in their footsteps.

This is because the way we conduct  business or design our infrastructure is entirely reliant on consumer  behaviour.

COVID-19 has given businesses a  chance to reevaluate, revamp, and refocus to be more sustainable. It offers huge challenges, but also new opportunities in Singapore  as well.

## How can partnerships help?

In recent years, the business world  has shown that it depends on a thriving society, but is still many years away  from creating a scale of business partnerships that can completely revamp our  economic model.

Many larger corporate companies  have partnered with tech startups to leverage a line of cutting-edge technology  and achieve greater change on a larger scale.

A perfect example for this is the  collaboration between a Canada based tech startup and a French food service  that joined forces to convert food waste into biodegradable plastic.

This is just one example that  proves that we are all part of a high functioning society and cannot work  alone. So, in order for big corporations to succeed, they need to be engaging  with startups.

## Eco-friendly modes of transport are  attracting consumers

Sustainable transportation options  like cycling have bloomed in the past couple of years.

Apart from them, many ride-sharing  services have been fully functional ever since the lockdown restrictions  started to ease, and people warmed up to the idea of embracing e-scooters and  cycles as their primary means of transportation.

Specialists have realised that most  people don’t cycle to work due to the lack of infrastructure that prioritises  this mode of transport. The cities were not built with cyclists in mind.

But now, after COVID-19, many government officials are seen  cycling to work in order to  promote a green environment and quite a few are working towards including  cycling infrastructure in city planning schemes that involve protected bike  lanes.

These sustainable options are also  more cost-effective, particularly in times where petrol prices are at a high,  like the current situation in Singapore.

The Ukraine-Russia conflict has  pushed up these prices, forcing consumers to look for other less expensive  alternatives.

There have also been business  initiatives that offer a tax reduction on employees that buy bicycles, which  shows that businesses are keen to adopt more sustainable commute options.

## Sustainable buildings will dominate  the world after COVID-19

While we know that the climate  crisis is a critical and pressing issue, real  estate is a prominent part of the solution.

When corporations have too much at  stake with claims of being green energy and sustainability friendly, their  sustainable office buildings are a huge part of the office market for COVID-19.

Sustainable office buildings  function either by:

1. Reducing the time of commute for employees between their homes or  office and even business travel
2. Focusing entirely on digitising or maintaining a sustainable design

Different working policies are also  underway at many corporations that allow the office space to be used much more  efficiently.

## Restructuring quality

Focusing on sustainability in a  post-COVID world requires an in-depth knowledge of consumer  behaviours and analytical data to back it up.

In this market where quality  restructures are taking place to adopt more sustainable options, you need strategic planners who can look out for long-term  outcomes.

Ever-changing environments in  business settings will require thoughtful and careful reconsideration. It will  fall on the managers and upper corporate leaders to promote efficiency, safety  and quality in the workplace.

While the consumer demands are  changing in a rather rapid fashion, you can identify common trends, the most  prominent one being that people are unwilling to sacrifice the environment for  their daily comforts anymore.

More investors and builders are  basing their entire planning and investments around the idea of a global,  sustainable real estate.

## Mental health is part of the package

The professional realm has gotten  entangled with the comforts of one’s personal realm with over half of the world  working remotely from their homes due to the global crisis.

Employers understand the need to  support the physical and mental health of their teams and are always looking  for different ways to introduce  wellness programs that boost morale and team productivity.

Returning to work in a post-COVID  era has seen employees rebranding their work stations with meditation pods,  more fresh air with green spaces and integrated workplaces that focus on new  designs that exude sustainability and open space.

These open space designs can also  help alleviate people’s anxieties about in-person activity. This is where  technology has been helpful and has given employers the ability to monitor the  use of common spaces and track visitor access.

The pandemic also brought into perspective how working from home is  a viable option for many positions.  Contrary to prior beliefs, working from the office on alternate days may not  decrease productivity, but instead, increase it.

## Transparency goes a long way

The disruptions related to COVID-19 have also affected supply chains and the focus has now shifted because of consumer  preferences to know where their products come from.

There is a high demand for the need to make food systems  traceable and more transparent.  Traceability systems need to be strengthened and maintained in order to track  agricultural products from farm to form.

These kinds of assessments, driven  by analytical data, are the key to improving and developing a sustainable  business.
