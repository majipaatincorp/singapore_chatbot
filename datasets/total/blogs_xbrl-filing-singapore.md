Singapore has been a pioneer in implementing XBRL for financial reporting. Since its adoption in 2007, the country has seen significant benefits and improvements in the overall financial reporting process.

The use of XBRL has allowed for easier and more efficient collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial data. The process also increases transparency and compliance with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS).

Here is a comprehensive guide on XBRL filing in Singapore to help you understand the process and its benefits!

## What is XBRL Filing?

XBRL is an open standard language used for organising and exchanging financial data between businesses and regulatory bodies. It enables companies to tag financial data in a standardised format, making it easier to analyse and compare across different companies and industries.

### Is XBRL Filing Mandatory in Singapore?

In Singapore, using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) has become mandatory for companies filing financial statements with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), with some exceptions.

#### Who is Exempted From XBRL Filing?

Companies must meet the conditions listed in Section 201A of the Companies Act and the requirements to be a dormant company to qualify for exemption. It is advised to clarify and confirm whether a company meets the exemption criteria to avoid non-compliance penalties.

## What Are the Benefits of XBRL Filing?

- Efficient and accurate financial reporting: With XBRL, companies can reduce the time and effort spent on manual data entry and ensure more accurate financial reporting.
- Cost-effective: Filing in XBRL format eliminates the need for printing and manual submission of financial statements, resulting in cost savings for both companies and regulators.
- Enhanced transparency: XBRL facilitates easier access to financial data by standardizing the format, making it more transparent and comparable.
- Improved decision-making: For investors and analysts, XBRL provides a structured and consistent format for analyzing financial data, leading to better-informed investment decisions.

## How to File XBRL in Singapore

There are two primary ways of filing your company’s financial statements in XBRL format as part of its annual return:

1. Using the BizFinx tool and file via the BizFile+ portal
2. Using accounting software to prepare and file your annual return with simplified XBRL FS to ACRA

Alternatively, you can also engage a corporate services provider such as InCorp to help you file.

### What Are the XBRL Filing Requirements?

ACRA has implemented the revised XBRL filing requirements and data elements for businesses to streamline the filing of financial statements, which have been in force since 1 May 2021.

There are four templates that companies can use to meet the revised requirements and data elements:

1. Full XBRL template (210 data elements)
2. Simplified XBRL template (120 data elements)
3. XBRL FSH (Banks) template (80 data elements)
4. XBRL FSH (Insurance) template (80 data elements)

Note that XBRL FSH refers to the financial statement highlights where a company only needs to present key account details in XBRL as opposed to the full set.

Here is a table that shows the new requirements:
