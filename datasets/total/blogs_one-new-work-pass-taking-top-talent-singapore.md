## What Are the Benefits of the ONE Pass?

- Not subject to the upcoming Complementarity  Assessment Framework (COMPASS) for Employment Pass (EP) holders
- No restriction on the amount of time pass  holders need to look for work so that they can comfortably take as much time as  they need
- Can begin, run, and work for several firms  concurrently at any one time, which gives added work flexibility
- Longest pass validity as compared to the  other work passes so that pass holders feel assured being able to stay and work  for a significant period of time
- Need not apply for a new pass when you change  jobs that removes the hassle of re-application
- Spouses of pass holders can work with a  Letter of Consent

## How is the ONE Pass Different From the Other Professional Work  Passes in Singapore?

It is a unique pass that offers the greatest  employment flexibility as compared to the other work passes, like the  Employment Pass (EP) and Personalised Employment Pass (PEP).

Unlike them, ONE pass holders can take as  long as they need to find a new job, and they can work for multiple employers  at the same time.

They can also choose to be employed and  establish their own businesses at the same time. Conversely, PEP pass holders  cannot be entrepreneurs nor sole shareholders, and like EP pass holders, are  restricted to working for a single employer.

ONE pass holders also enjoy a longer pass  validity of 5 years, as compared to 2 years for EP holders and 3 years for PEP  holders. Upon pass expiry, PEP holders cannot renew their passes, but ONE pass  holders can do so.

## Why Was it Launched, and Who Does it Target?

The new work pass intends to attract highly  sought-after individuals who excel in niche fields like data science and  vaccine creation and possess valuable technical expertise.

It  also targets entrepreneurs establishing companies combining technology with a  traditional sector, such as fintech, agritech, and medtech.
