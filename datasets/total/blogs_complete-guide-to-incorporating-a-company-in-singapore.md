## What Are the Steps for Registering a Singapore Company?

We’ve covered how you can incorporate a Singapore company with requirements you need to meet to do so. Let’s get into exactly how to set up your company in Singapore with a simple step-by-step guide.

Having addressed the process of incorporating a Singapore company and the corresponding requirements, let us now delve into a comprehensive, easy-to-follow, and step-by-step guide on precisely how to establish your company in Singapore.

There are only 3 simple steps required to register your business in Singapore:

1. Company Name Approval
2. Registration Documents
3. Company Registration with ACRA

Let’s go into those 3 steps in a bit more detail.

### Step 1. Company Name Approval

Your first step to incorporate a Singapore company is to register your company name with the Singapore Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. Remember, all of these processes must be handled by a local Singapore company incorporation service provider.

There are just a few rules to follow:

- Your company name cannot be obscene.
- Your company name cannot infringe on existing trademarks.
- Your company name cannot be the same as any existing Singapore business.
- Your company name cannot be reserved by another company.

Assuming you can follow that simple criterion, ACRA can approve your company name in less than an hour. If you have a business that deals in fields that require a licence, for example, law, medicine, or finance, it will take a few weeks to approve the name. Once your company name has been approved, ACRA will hold it for you for 120 days. If you let it lapse, however, it can be released for someone else to use.

### Step 2. Registration Document

Once your company name has been approved, you’ll need to prepare registration documents to enable the CSP to incorporate your company online.

#### Company Registration Documents Required by ACRA:

- Consent to Act form from each director.
- Consent to Act form by the company secretary.
- A Company Constitution (formerly known as Articles of Association). You can create your own constitution or use the official template.
- Identification and proof of residential address for all officers and shareholders of the corporation.

In the interests of anti-money laundering regulations, your company incorporation service provider will also need to do some due diligence on your company, which is called “Know Your Customer” (KYC).

Your chosen Singapore company incorporation service will walk you through each of the registration documents, so it should be a very seamless process. These registration documents should be completed and approved within 1 day.

### Step 3. Company Registration with ACRA

Once your company name has been approved and you’ve submitted your registration documents, you’re ready to be registered with the Singapore Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. This is done online and takes less than an hour. Sometimes, but not often, it might need to be referred to another government department, which will take a few extra weeks. For the vast majority of new businesses, you’ll be officially able to operate in Singapore within just 1 day!

## What to Do After Your Company Has Been Registered in Singapore

If you’ve done everything correctly, you’ll be allowed to do business officially in Singapore straight away. There are, however a few extra things you’ll want to do in the following days and weeks:

- Apply for any business licences you might need, e.g. medicine, law, etc.
- Open a corporate bank account.
- Register for Singapore Goods and Services Tax (GST).
- If you’re an importer or exporter, register with Singapore Customs.
- Put your ACRA registration number on all letterheads, invoices and other official collateral.
- Apply for any Singapore work visas needed by you or your foreign team members.
- Make sure you stay in compliance with ACRA.

Most helpfully, your company incorporation service provider can assist you in all of the above, whether it be introducing you to a few bank managers or taking care of your tax compliance.
