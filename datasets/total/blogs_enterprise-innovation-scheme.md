Singapore recognises the significance of driving innovation and growth in its business landscape. Thus, it unveiled the Enterprise Innovation Scheme (EIS) in Budget 2023. This scheme is a significant step towards achieving the country’s goal of becoming a global hub for technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

In this blog, we take you through the different aspects of the EIS, including what it covers, the qualifying conditions, application process, and more.

## What is the Enterprise Innovation Scheme in Singapore?

The EIS is a government initiative to promote innovation and enhance productivity among Singapore businesses. Its qualifying period is from YA 2024 to YA 2028. Here are the key aspects of the Enterprise Innovation Scheme:

Note that in the situation where a body of persons (BOP) is expected to carry on a business under Section 11 of the Singapore Income Tax Act 1947, the BOP is eligible for EIS enhanced deductions/allowances if it meets the qualifying conditions stated in the table above. However, it will not be eligible for the cash payout.

## What is the Option to Convert Qualifying Expenditure Into a Cash Payout?

This is a cash payout aimed at helping small and growing businesses alleviate the costs of their innovation activities.

Eligible businesses can choose to convert up to S$100,000 of their total qualifying expenditure across all the qualifying activities for each YA into cash at a 20% conversion rate. The cash payout is capped at S$20,000 and is not taxable.

Partial cash conversion can be chosen for qualifying R&amp;D performed in Singapore, licensing of IPRs, training and innovation projects done with polytechnics, the ITE or other qualified partners. Partial cash conversion is not allowed for IP registration and IPR acquisition.

For IP registration and IPR acquisition, the option to convert qualifying expenditure into a cash payout will be on a per IP registration or per IPR basis, where:

- Businesses must convert the full IP registration costs to cash payout, subject to the cap
- Qualifying companies or partnerships must convert the full amount of qualifying IPR acquisition costs incurred on a qualifying IPR into cash, subject to the cap
- Any IP registration or acquisition of IPR costs incurred beyond the cap will be forfeited and will not be able to be deducted against the business income

After an amount of qualifying expenditure is converted into cash, the same amount cannot be used for tax deductions and/or allowances. The option to convert the qualifying expenditure cannot be revoked once exercised.

The option to convert qualifying expenditure into a cash payout is available on a yearly basis. A qualifying business that wants to convert its qualifying expenditure into cash must make the irrevocable election by submitting its application via the Apply for EIS Cash Payout digital service after filing its income tax return and before the income tax filing due date for the relevant YA.
