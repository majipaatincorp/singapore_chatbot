## Single Country Payroll Outsourcing Services in Singapore

Under the Employment Act, you must pay your employees’ salaries at least once a month and within seven days of the end of the salary period. For Singapore citizens and permanent residents, you also need to contribute to their CPF accounts. The government-backed “Work Right” Campaign now gives employees an opportunity to flag up any late payments of CPF funds, so it’s absolutely imperative you have a streamlined system in place.

### How InCorp Payroll Management Works

Upon engagement of our Payroll Management Services, an Accounts Manager is assigned to you to work on your payroll requirements. He will review and organize the information you submit to us, and subsequently create and maintain a payroll ledger based on the data. In addition, he will make salary payouts and submit all required payroll taxes according to your instructions.
