The family office  landscape in Asia has been undergoing a significant transformation in recent  years. Singapore has emerged as one of the top global destinations for  ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) to establish their family offices.

Amongst  the tumult of COVID-19 and shifting political tides globally, Singapore has  nearly doubled its family office holdings from 400 in 2020 to 700 in 2023.

It is not just facing  prominent demand from just Asia, but also beyond, such as Europe and America.  Increasingly, these non-Asian families are choosing Singapore to establish  family offices or satellite offices to seize and support their regional  investments.

There is good reason for  this, and it is not just because of Singapore’s traditional advantages —  Singapore is making major plays to attract UHNWIs, and will continue to do so.

Let us discuss why  Singapore continues to be an ideal home for family offices beyond the region,  taking into consideration the historical success factors, recent developments  and updates, and the future outlook for the industry.

## Historical Success of Family  Offices in Singapore

Before we look too far  towards the future, let us take a look at the foundational elements of  Singapore that have traditionally made it an attractive location for family  offices.

### Strategic  Location

Singapore’s strategic  location at the heart of Asia has made it an attractive hub for UHNWIs seeking  to manage their wealth and investments closer in the region.

Its proximity to emerging  markets in the region, coupled with excellent connectivity and infrastructure,  allows family offices to access a diverse range of investment opportunities and  tap into the growing Asian market.

In terms of a strategic  gate between West to East, you could not find a better location.

### Stable  Political and Economic Environment

One of the key factors  that have contributed to Singapore’s success as a family office hub is its  stable political and economic environment.

The city-state has  consistently ranked highly in various global indices for its:

- Political stability (third in the world)
- Economic freedom (first in the world)
- Ease of doing business (second in the world)

These factors provide a  secure and conducive environment for wealth management and preservation.

### Robust  Regulatory Framework

Singapore is well-regarded  for its robust regulatory framework, which promotes transparency, integrity,  and compliance with international standards.

The Monetary Authority of  Singapore (MAS) has implemented policies and regulations specifically tailored  for family offices.

These policies ensure that  they operate within a well-regulated environment while offering a high degree  of flexibility and confidentiality.

A prime example of this  would be the Family Office Development Team (FODT) set up but the MAS in 2019  to lead and create initiatives that will enhance Singapore’s position as the  primary Global Family Office Hub in Asia and beyond.

The FODT looks to build an  ecosystem that is responsive to the evolving needs of family offices and their  UHNWI clients and to promote Singapore as a trusted and well-regulated hub for  family offices.

## Recent Developments and  Updates

Time and time again,  Singapore has shown it’s not willing to rest on the laurels of strong  foundational components, and the family office sector is no exception. The  government has continued to invest in the sector, both through financial and  legislative efforts.

### Enhancing  Quality and Economic Benefits

MAS  implemented more stringent tax regulations last year that stipulate  minimum capital, local investment, and talent recruitment requirements for  family offices to be eligible for tax incentives.

Family office-managed or  advised funds must maintain a minimum fund size of S$10 million upon  application and S$20 million within two years.

Furthermore, family  offices falling under this section are required to employ at least two  investment professionals. Previously, no such stipulations existed for fund  sizes or employees.

These revised regulations  indicate the Singaporean authorities’ commitment to improving the calibre of  family offices and creating positive economic repercussions for the  country.

Ultimately, they render  Singapore even more appealing in its reliability and security for UHNWIs  seeking to establish family offices.

### Global-Asia  Family Office Circle Network

The launch of the Global-Asia Family Office Circle network in 2021 has  provided a "trusted ecosystem" for industry players to collaborate  and share best practices, according to Ms Foo Mee Har, CEO of the Wealth  Management Institute and Member of Parliament.

This initiative further  strengthens Singapore’s family office ecosystem and enhances its appeal to  UHNWIs by advocating for targeted tax incentives.

### Capturing  New Opportunities in Philanthropy

A new tax donation scheme  has been introduced to ground family offices in Singapore, enhancing the  city-state’s status as  a hub for philanthropy.

It presents a new  opportunity for Singapore in an aspect that the ultra-rich is paying a more  significant deal of attention to.

Unlike in the past,  philanthropy has become more deliberate and strategic, with younger generations  preferring to be more hands-on with active engagements.

This initiative aligns  with the increasing focus on social impact and sustainability among UHNWIs,  making Singapore an even more compelling choice for family offices.

Individuals with family  offices will receive a 100% tax deduction for donations made overseas, allowing  for increased philanthropic contributions.

To qualify for this tax  deduction, donations must be made through approved local intermediaries.  However, the tax deduction is capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income,  ensuring a balance between promoting philanthropy and maintaining fiscal  responsibility.

With this, Singapore sends  a message to family offices keen on giving back to the local community in the  region, cementing itself as the best place to do so.

## The Future of Family  Offices in Singapore

With the ongoing global  economic uncertainty and the growing importance of Asia in the world economy,  Singapore’s relevance as a family office hub is expected to continue.

The city-state’s  commitment to innovation and adaptability, along with its continuous efforts to  enhance its regulatory framework and support systems for family offices,  positions it well to remain an attractive destination for UHNWIs and their  wealth management needs.
