**FAQs on Trademark Global Registration**

What is the Madrid System for trademark global registration?

The Madrid System provides a centralized and streamlined process for registering trademarks in multiple countries. It is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and currently includes over 130 member countries. This means that businesses can use the Madrid System to register their trademarks in multiple countries at once, rather than having to go through the individual registration processes for each country.



Can I file a Madrid Protocol application directly with WIPO?

No, you cannot file a Madrid Protocol application directly with WIPO. You must first apply in your home country or region and then use that application as the basis for your international application.
