****How Does Taxation Work in Singapore?**

Singapore adopts a modified territorial tax system. This means that tax is imposed on all income accrued in or derived from Singapore, and on all foreign-sourced income remitted to the country. Though notably, there are exemptions for qualifying foreign-sourced income including dividends, branch profits, and service income.

Other notable tax considerations are – no capital gains and dividends tax, lower withholding taxes, advance tax rulings, and no significant restrictions on foreign exchange transactions and capital movements in Singapore. Singapore also has an 9% Goods and Services Tax (GST) with effect from 1st January 2024, levied at two levels – upon the import of goods, and supply of goods and services in Singapore.

The headline corporate income tax rate in Singapore is currently **17%**, but the effective tax rate is lower because of various exemptions. As a general rule, a Singapore company is taxed on the income earned in the preceding financial year and is considered a tax resident if its control and management are exercised in the city-state.
