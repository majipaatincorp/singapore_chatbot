# Comparison: Branch Office vs Representative Office

<!-- image -->

Foreign investors have a wealth of options when it comes to structuring their business presence in Singapore. They should carefully evaluate their specific business goals and requirements to determine the most suitable corporate structure for their operations.

This chart provides a side-by-side comparison of the three incorporation options for foreign companies intending to set up and operate in Singapore, namely: a representative office, and a branch office.

## Representative Office

A representative office in Singapore represents the most basic form of business presence in a foreign country, though it comes with significant limitations. Essentially serving as an initial foothold, ROs typically require registration with the local authorities but are usually restricted from conducting revenue-generating activities.

## Branch Office

A branch office (BO) functions as a direct continuation of an established legal entity within the company group, expanding into a new jurisdiction. This is usually accomplished through the registration or qualification of a foreign entity in the target country. BOs are established with the intention of generating revenue and operating production facilities within the host country.
