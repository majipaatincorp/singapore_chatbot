- Incorporate Your Company in Singapore With  InCorp

As the gateway to Asia,  Singapore is situated in a prime location with world-class business-friendly  infrastructure and policies. It makes for an excellent starting point for both  foreign entrepreneurs and businesses seeking to penetrate the region.

Hence, it is no surprise  that many foreigners from around the world are interested in registering a  company in Singapore. In this article, we help to break down the company  registration process, and highlight the key aspects you need to know!

## Why Should You Incorporate  a Business in Singapore?

Singapore presents a  compelling case for foreigners to start a business. It has a business-friendly  environment, a highly supportive local government, and plenty of schemes that  make it the prime choice.

Here are more reasons that  make Singapore the ideal place to set up a business:

### Ease  of Doing Business

Singapore  was recently ranked first in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) as the best business  environment in the world, a position that it has proudly kept for the past 15  years.

Setting up and operating a  company in Singapore is remarkably straightforward due to its business-friendly  regulatory environment and streamlined procedures.

Singapore boasts an  efficient incorporation process, and the government offers a plethora of  helpful resources and support for businesses.

### Attractive  Tax System

Singapore’s tax  environment is highly attractive, with corporate  tax rates  that are both competitive and with tax incentives and exemptions.

Since YA 2020, for the  first 3 years of a company’s incorporation in Singapore, 75% of the first  S$100,000 of profits earned are exempt from paying taxes.

Shareholders of Singapore  companies also benefit from the absence of tax on dividends and capital gains.

Moreover, Singapore has  formed an extensive network of double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAA) that  significantly help reduce the tax burdens for businesses involved in  international commerce.

Competitive  Workforce and Talent Pool
Singapore has a highly  skilled and multicultural workforce that thrives in a conducive environment for  cross-cultural collaboration. As a hub for global talent, companies can take  advantage of various programs and incentives to attract and retain top talent.

Political  Stability and Anti-Corruption Approach
Singapore boasts of a  stable political environment, a robust legal system, and an unwavering  commitment to the rule of law. These qualities make Singapore a secure hub for  businesses, ensuring the protection of their investments and intellectual property rights.
100%  Foreign Ownership
Foreigners incorporating a  company in Singapore can enjoy complete ownership of its shareholding. They  must register their business with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory  Authority (ACRA). 

3 Ways a Foreigner Can  Register a Company in Singapore
There are 3 possible  routes a foreigner can choose to start a Singapore company. They are:
Move  to Singapore and Get an EntrePass
You can apply for an  EntrePass that allows qualifying foreign entrepreneurs to start and run a  business in Singapore. 
The pass is open to all  citizenships and nationalities. Potential applicants must fulfil these 2  conditions before they can apply:


Have started, or plans to start,       a private limited company that is registered with ACRA

The company must either:

Be venture-backed
Have innovative technologies

If the company is already        registered, it must be less than 6 months old on the application date
If the company is not yet        registered, applicants can do so after knowing the result of their        application

Must meet any of the listed       criteria as an entrepreneur, innovator, or investor on the  Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s website

Note that if you are  successful in your application, you are advised to contribute to Singapore’s  local startup scene through these activities:


Offering mentorship for other       startups
Being a host or speaker at       workshops or seminars
Arranging for networking or       deal-making meetings

Some businesses are not  eligible for an EntrePass:

Geomancy firms
Employment firms
Anything related to traditional       Chinese medicine, such as acupuncture businesses
Massage parlours and foot       reflexology
Businesses related to the night       scene, such as bars, nightclubs, and karaoke lounges
Certain F&amp;B establishments       such as hawkers, food courts, and coffee shops

Apart from complete  ownership of the Singapore company’s shareholdings, an EntrePass holder can also  be the company’s director or employee. 
You must, however, enlist  a registered filing agent to help you submit your application on your behalf. 
Move  to Singapore and Obtain an Employment Pass (EP)
After you incorporate a  business in Singapore, you can relocate to the city-state by obtaining an EP.  You can engage the services of a registered filing agent such as InCorp to  submit your EP application on your behalf. 
Note that you may only  start a private limited company for this route. You must also hire a registered  filing agent to help you file your company setup application.
Remain  Overseas and Engage a Locally Resident Representative
Foreigners residing  overseas can incorporate a company in Singapore with the help of a locally  resident nominee director or authorised representative to run the business. 
This local resident can be  a:


Singapore Citizen
Singapore Permanent Resident (PR)
EntrePass or Employment Pass (EP)       holder

You will also need to  engage a registered filing agent such as InCorp to submit your application to  ACRA’s BizFile+ portal. 
InCorp also provides other  company incorporation services, such as a registered business address, company  secretary, and nominee director assistance. 

What Are the Requirements  to Register a Business in Singapore for Foreigners?
A foreigner can start a  business in Singapore easily. These are the basic requirements:


At least 1 Singapore-based       director
At least 1 shareholder
At least S$1 paid-up capital, in       any currency
A registered business address in       Singapore
A local company secretary


What Are the Business  Entities in Singapore?
Depending on the means  that they choose to set up a company in Singapore, foreigners have several  business entities that they can choose from. We explore them below: 
Private  Limited Company (Pte Ltd)
A private limited company  is the most popular option for both locals and foreigners setting up a company  in Singapore. 
Apart from being highly  flexible and scaleable, this business entity type also benefits from the best  tax regimes. A private limited company has these key features:


Has share capital
Has 50 shareholders at most
Businesses can be individuals,       shareholders, or a mix of both

Partnership  (Ordinary, Limited, and Limited Liability)
A partnership, whether  ordinary, limited, or limited liability, involves at least 2 or more  individuals. However, for ordinary partnerships, it must incorporate as a local  company instead if it exceeds 20 partners; for the rest, there is no limit. 
Of these, the limited  liability partnership tends to be the preferred option for incorporating  companies. This is because it maintains a separate legal entity from its  partners, and the partners also have limited liability. 
In the case of company  debt and losses, the partners are only personally liable for those arising from  their own wrongful actions, and not of other partners. 
Sole  Proprietorship
A sole proprietorship is  the least preferred company entity compared to the other options. Despite being  relatively more straightforward, it is also riskier because the business owner  assumes personal responsibility for the business’ debts and losses, which is  also unlimited. 
This means that the  owner’s personal assets are not protected from the business’ liabilities. If  the business incurs debt, the creditors can demand payment from the individual  or company’s assets. 
It is also considered the  same entity as the owner – whether the owner is an individual or a legal  entity. 

What is the Process of  Company Registration in Singapore?
The company registration  process in Singapore involves these primary steps:


Determine how you wish to       incorporate your company in Singapore – whether you want to run it from       Singapore or from overseas
Choose your ideal business       structure from the available options
Reserve your company name
Register your company with ACRA

Note that while company  name applications are usually approved or rejected within a day, any additional  referrals require a longer time of 14 to 60 days. 
After a name application  has been approved, it will be reserved for 120 days. You must ensure that your  company is registered within this timeframe. 
When you submit your  company registration application, you must ensure that all the documents are in  place. Most applications are approved within a day. 
However, similar to the  name application, additional referrals or approvals will also take 14 to 60  days. 

What Are the Documents  Needed for Company Registration in Singapore?
Remember that you must  engage a registered filing agent to submit your company application to ACRA.  Here are the documents you must furnish your application with:


Company name
Company’s SSIC code and brief       description of primary activities
Details of company shareholders       and directors
Share capital information
Registered business address in       Singapore
Company constitution


What Happens After  Incorporation?
The tasks do not end after  your company incorporation. There are also other things to do, such as opening  a corporate bank account and registering for Goods and Services Tax (GST). 
Receiving  Your Certificate of Incorporation and Free Business Profile
After you register your  company successfully, ACRA will send you an email notification that acts as  your certificate of incorporation. It will also have your company registration  number, the Unique Entity Number (UEN). 
You will also receive a  free business profile, which is an electronic report that has your company  details. This profile can be used by potential stakeholders for background  checks. 
Engaging  a Company Secretary and Auditor
Companies in Singapore  must employ a company secretary within 6 months after incorporation and a  company auditor within 3 months of incorporation. 
They may not need to  appoint an auditor if they are exempt.  
Opening  a Business Bank Account
Companies in Singapore are  highly encouraged to open a corporate bank account. There are a few options you  can choose from:


Opening with a traditional bank       (DBS, OCBC, UOB)
Opening with a digital bank       (ANEXT, Green Link Digital Bank)
Opening with a neobank (Aspire,       Wise, Revolut)

Applying  for a Business Licence
You may need to apply for  a business licence depending on the business activities you plan to engage in.  You must perform this activity after you incorporate your company in Singapore  and before you start operating it. 
GST  Registration
If you reasonably expect  your company’s yearly turnover to be more than S$1 million, you must register  for GST. Otherwise, you are not required to do so. 
Corppass  Registration
You can register for  Corppass, a corporate digital identity for businesses in Singapore, to transact  with government agencies online. 
Visit the Corppass website to establish and manage  it. You can also give access to your company’s employees so that they can  transact on the company’s behalf with their Singpass accounts. 
Annual  Filing Requirements
The Singapore Companies  Act has annual filing requirements that companies must follow. Here is the list  of the important deadlines to note:


File IR8A for employees on 1       March every year
File ECI on 31 March every year
Hold Annual General Meeting (AGM)       within 6 months after the financial year end (FYE) for non-listed       companies (private companies may not need to do so under Section 175A of       the Act)
File Annual Returns (AR) within 7       months of the FYE
File corporate tax on 30 November       online every year

Immigration
If you plan to hire  foreign employees, there are certain work passes that they need to obtain  before they can enter Singapore and start working for your business. 
For example, most  professionals and executives require an EP work visa. There are eligibility  requirements that they must meet before the work pass can be issued to them,  such as having a monthly salary of at least S$5,000.
