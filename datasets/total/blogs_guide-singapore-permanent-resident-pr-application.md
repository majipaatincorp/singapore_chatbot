The vibrant city of Singapore boasts many benefits for its inhabitants – whether it is its world-class infrastructure, facilities, and more, it has made foreigners hailing from all parts of the world want to call it home.

In this blog, we take a look at how they can do so by delving into the various routes that they can consider in obtaining permanent residency.

## What Are the Options for Singapore PR Application?

Foreigners can become Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and enjoy the benefits that come with being one, such as stability, attractive job opportunities, and infrastructure.

Foreigners must apply for an Entry Permit with the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to become a PR.

There are several pathways for different groups of individuals to do so in Singapore. They are:

- The Global Investor Programme (GIP)
- The Professionals, Technical Personnel, and Skilled Workers (PTS) Scheme
- The ForArts Scheme

We take a closer look at the schemes below:

### Pathway for Investors: The GIP Scheme

The Global Investor Programme (GIP) in Singapore aims to attract high-net-worth individuals, entrepreneurs, business owners, and investors worldwide to invest and contribute to Singapore’s economy.

Specifically, it targets:

- Established business owners
- Next-generation business owners
- Founders of fast-growth firms
- Family office principals

The GIP offers a pathway for eligible applicants to obtain Singapore Permanent Residence (PR). Under the programme, individuals must make a substantial investment in specific types of companies, funds, or schemes in Singapore.

Successful applicants and their families can gain Singapore PR status by participating in the GIP and making the necessary investments. It also offers the potential for long-term residency and eventual citizenship.

#### Assessment Conditions for Investment

Those who meet the qualifying criteria must also choose one of these 3 investment options. Note that family office principals can only opt for Option C.
