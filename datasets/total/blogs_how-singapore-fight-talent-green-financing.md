# How Can Singapore Fight for Talent in Green Financing?

<!-- image -->

Green is growing – but can Singapore find key talent to transform  the sector?

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has predicted there will  be  US$200  billion per year of green investments into ASEAN countries by 2030.

From green bonds to green loans, these forms of green financing  are steadily making their way into the region. And as the world shifts towards  achieving sustainable development goals and environmental sustainability, this  trend will only continue in the future.

Singapore has certainly seen the Environmental, Social, and  Governance (ESG) writing on the wall, launching the Singapore Green Plan 2030  in 2021, and more specifically, the Enterprise Sustainability Programme within  it.

Unsurprisingly, ESG job demand has also risen 257% in the past three years.  With the rise in awareness and demand for sustainable finance comes a new set  of challenges — namely, a scarcity of professionals  with the right skill sets.

## What Steps Are Singapore Taking to Build Green Financing Talent?

Clearly, there is demand – SkillsFuture Singapore lists the green  economy as an area of high growth. Parliamentary discussions have also  emphasised on the urgent need to build skills for green jobs.

The big problem is, green finance is a young field, with few  experts to be found. What exactly is the skill set for each particular  industry? What about each business? Being a relatively small city-state, the  talent pool in Singapore is even smaller.

It is essential for Singapore to grow its talent capable of  shaping the future for improved environmental and social outcomes. This step is  necessary for the country to enhance the green economy and position it as a  sustainable finance hub.

The good news is, Singapore can take, (and is taking) proactive  steps to ensure that we have the human capital to meet this rising demand. Here  are some thoughts on how Singapore can stay ahead of the green finance game.

### A Focus on Young Talent

Education has long been the cornerstone of Singapore’s development  strategy (with over  91% tertiary enrolment), and this is no different  when it comes to the environment and green finance.

The Ministry of Education (MOE) has been working with Institutes  of Higher Learning (IHLs) since 2021 to create courses and programmes that  develop and deepen students’ knowledge and skills in sustainability.

One such example is Temasek Polytechnic’s Integrative Built  Environment Centre, which aims to train approximately 2,000 students on ESG  practices through internships.

In 2021, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College East  established the ITE-SembCorp Centre for Sustainable Solutions to provide a  training centre for integrated sustainable solutions.

The goal is to train 400 students each year so that they can join  Singapore’s growing solar industry.

The National University of Singapore (NUS) has also partnered with  the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute (SGFIN) to launch a new Master of  Science programme in Sustainable and Green Finance.

Students will be trained in sustainable finance theories,  frameworks, get exposure to green innovations, and understand real-world  problems faced.

They will also be equipped with the skills to think beyond the  conventional methods of optimising financial profits. Ultimately, they will  urge companies to make Singapore a better place to live in for generations  ahead.

The good news is that this is a terrific long-term bet — the  younger generation is already onboard with ESG. Being raised with the internet  and being exposed to a more globalised world, they are far more aware of the  issues we face and are eager to make a difference.

### Building Talent From Within

Continuing education and upskilling will be crucial for Singapore  to stay ahead of the curve.

Unfortunately, most upper management is far too busy focusing on  their core responsibilities to see the bigger picture and how sustainability  can be integrated into their business strategy.

To some executives, not only does ESG look like just another acronym  to comply with, it looks like it has the potential to open up the business to  new risks and liabilities.

They need to be convinced that this is not the case — ESG can  create new opportunities for growth, lower costs, and attract top talent. There  is a reason MAS is making such a big bet on it.

Fortunately, those higher learning courses mentioned earlier are  also open to those already in the workforce.

Institutes like Temasek Polytechnic’s Integrative Built  Environment Centre and ITE-SembCorp Centre for Sustainable Solutions aim to  provide working professionals with the knowledge and skills they need to  implement sustainable solutions in their organisations.

These are just a few examples, but they illustrate an important  point — if we want to make an impact now, we need to focus on upskilling those  who are already in the workforce. The future is important, but the present is  where the rubber meets the road.

### Seeking Talent From Abroad With the ONE Pass

Singapore has always been brilliant at modifying and evolving its working  visas to attract the best talent the world has to  offer.

The latest such visa is the Overseas Networks and Expertise Pass  (ONE), which is Singapore’s most flexible working visa to date. Selected talent  can take as long as they need to find a job, and they can work for multiple  employers at any one time.

They are also allowed to establish their own business, even if  they are employed by another business at that time.

This is in contrast to other visas like the Employment Pass (EP)  and Personalised Employment Pass (PEP) which have more restrictions as it  relates to entrepreneurship and employment.

The ONE Pass is valid for 5 years, which is much longer than the 2  years of the EP and 3 years for the PEP.

The ONE Pass aims to make a great difference for entrepreneurs and  those who wish to establish themselves in Singapore, but it should also have a  significant impact on attracting appropriately skilled talent in the green  finance space.

Applications are available from 1 January 2023, but there are  restrictions. If you wish to find out how to get overseas green finance talent,  you can  read more  about the ONE Pass here.

## A Long Fight for Sustainability

Sustainability is a long-term mission, and we need experienced  professionals to help us understand and manage key problems.

As Singapore strives to become a global leader in sustainable  finance, it is important that the workforce is equipped with the appropriate  skills and knowledge.

If we can focus on all three of these areas — students, working  professionals, and overseas talent — we will be in a much better position to  achieve our green finance goals.
