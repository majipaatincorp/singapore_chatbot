As a company that champions industry in Southeast Asia, you might  be surprised to know we are bullish about Singapore raising its carbon tax  levels progressively from 2024.

This ambitious goal indicates Singapore’s commitment to becoming a  leader in sustainability and environmental protection.

The country is taking bold steps to secure a greener and more  sustainable future for all, resulting in a stronger economy.

While the increase in carbon tax may seem like a challenge to  some, it presents a unique opportunity for businesses, especially those  in the manufacturing sector.

It will bring about positive changes that will benefit the  environment and improve their operations to make them more competitive in the long run.

Simply put, taking action on climate change is not only the right  thing to do for the planet, but it is also good for business.

First, let us take a quick look at what the carbon taxes are, and  how they will affect the manufacturing sector in Singapore.

## What Are Carbon Taxes?

Carbon taxes are taxes levied on the carbon content of  industrial emissions.

The idea behind carbon taxes is to encourage the reduction of  greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change.

Carbon taxes are one of the tools that governments can use to  reduce emissions and promote cleaner, low-carbon energy sources.

## Why Did Singapore Increase its Carbon Tax?

Singapore’s carbon tax was implemented on January 1, 2019, via the  Carbon Pricing Act (CPA).

It is Southeast Asia’s first carbon pricing scheme. The carbon tax  is applied to all sectors, including energy-intensive and trade-exposed  industries.

Singapore’s carbon tax rate is currently set at S$5/tCO2e  (Singapore dollars per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent) from 2019 to 2023 as a  transitional period to give emitters time to adjust.

However, the carbon tax levels in Singapore will be raised  progressively starting in 2024 to achieve the nation’s climate ambition of  net zero emissions by mid-century.

The carbon tax will be increased to $25/tCO2e in 2024 and 2025 and  $45/tCO2e in 2026 and 2027. It is expected to reach $50-80/tCO2e by 2030.

The revenue from the carbon tax increase will be used to support  decarbonisation efforts, the transition to a green economy, and cushion the  impact on businesses and households.

## How Will the Singapore Carbon Tax Affect its  Manufacturing Sector?

One key way the rising Singapore carbon tax will impact the manufacturing  sector is by providing a strong price signal and impetus for businesses to reduce their carbon footprint.

This is particularly important for energy-intensive and  trade-exposed sectors, which will be subject to the carbon tax without  exemption.

The tax will encourage businesses to find more efficient and  sustainable ways to reduce their carbon tax obligations by putting a price  on carbon emissions. Ultimately, it will lead to improved bottom lines and more  opportunities.

- New Technologies
   One of the ways that businesses can reduce their emissions is by investing  in low-carbon technologies and carbon markets.  
The government’s revised and increased carbon tax trajectory will incentivise  businesses to make these investments.  
This will help businesses to be more competitive in a  low-carbon future and create local demand for high-quality carbon  credits to catalyse the development of well-functioning and regulated  carbon markets.

- Carbon Credits
   In addition to investing in low-carbon technologies and carbon  markets, businesses can also offset their emissions by surrendering  high-quality international carbon credits.  
As announced at Budget 2022, companies in Singapore will be able  to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions from 2024 using these  credits.  
This will provide a cushion for businesses that can source  cost-effective carbon credits and help create local demand for high-quality  carbon credits.
- Transitional Framework
   While the carbon tax and the use of international carbon credits  are important tools for encouraging businesses to reduce their emissions,  transitioning to a low-carbon economy may not be easy for everyone.  
Thankfully, the government has introduced a transition framework  to give existing emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) companies more time  to adjust. 
Under this framework, existing facilities in EITE sectors will  receive transitory allowances for part of their emissions, based on efficiency  standards and decarbonisation targets.  
This will help to maintain business competitiveness in the near  term and mitigate the risk of carbon leakage.
