# Wealthy Chinese Are Setting Up Family Offices in Singapore. Here’s Why

<!-- image -->

In recent years, Singapore has seen a significant increase in the  number of family offices and private entities used to manage a family’s wealth.

According to Citi Private Bank, the number of family  offices in Singapore jumped fivefold between  2017 and 2019, nearly doubling from 400 at the end of 2020 to 700 in 2021.

This trend is partly driven by wealthy Chinese individuals seeking  to move their capital and families out of China.

These individuals are not just seeking to protect their wealth but also to take advantage of the rising economic strength of the ASEAN  region.

## The Importance of Family Offices

A family office is an important tool for wealthy individuals and  families looking to manage their wealth professionally and efficiently.

It can provide a range of services, including:

- Asset       management
- Tax       planning
- Estate       planning
- Philanthropy
- Financial       planning

By establishing a family office, individuals and families can centralise  the management of their wealth and ensure that it is being handled  responsibly and strategically.

There are 2 main types of family offices:

1. Single-family       office: Helps 1 individual and their family only
2. Multi-family       office: Assists more than 1 family and has more cost-savings due to       economies of scale

## The Growing Popularity of Family Offices in Singapore

Singapore has long been a popular destination for wealthy  individuals and families, particularly those from China.

The city-state’s stable and well-regulated financial system, absence of wealth tax, and range of professional services make it an  appealing choice for those seeking to manage and grow their wealth.

In recent years, Singapore’s attractiveness as a destination has  been further enhanced by the country’s  expanding economy and favourable business  climate.

They have attracted a growing number of ultra-high-net-worth  individuals (UHNWIs) worldwide.

According to Citywire Asia, the Monetary Authority of Singapore  (MAS) approved over 100 family office applications in the first 4 months of  2022. This figure includes single-family offices and multi-family offices.

## Why Are Wealthy Chinese Choosing Singapore for Family Offices?

So, of all the other choices available, why are affluent Chinese  opting to set up family offices in Singapore?

One reason is that Singapore offers a range of professional  services and expertise for those seeking to establish a family office.

It also has relevant support available for interested parties,  such as that from the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB).

We explore more possible reasons:

- A Better Alternative
One of the main reasons why wealthy Chinese individuals are  establishing family offices in Singapore is to move their capital and families  out of the mainland. 
Since the Hong Kong protests back in 2019, they have been looking  for alternative locations to keep their funds. In 2021, the trend also picked  up after Beijing’s unannounced crackdown on the education industry and focus on  moderate wealth for all.
- Backed by Talent
The city-state understands the importance of nurturing industry  talent to seize opportunities and meet the ever-changing needs of the family  office ecosystem. 
It has a strong pool of talent across a comprehensive range of  professional services. From wealth and asset management to legal and tax  advisory and more, the country is well-supported by its people. 
Local training provider Wealth Management Institute (WMI), for  example, has established the WMI Family Office Programme to support this rapid  growth in the family offices sector by bolstering the talent pool.
- A Robust Community
Several family office communities in Singapore promote and support  the growth of these FOs.  
For example, WMI established the Global-Asia Family Office Circle  (GFO Circle) to encourage the sharing of knowledge and networking among  investment advisors, professionals, and family office principals. 
Other communities include the Business Families Institute @  Singapore Management University (BFI@SMU), Family Business Network (FBN) Asia,  and the Milken Institute.
- A Strategically Positioned Wealth Management  Hub
The country’s geographic location at the crossroads of East and  West also makes it an ideal base for managing and growing wealth within  the region. 
Singapore’s proximity to the rest of Southeast Asia and its well-developed  transportation and telecommunications infrastructure make it an attractive  location for businesses looking to tap into the region’s expanding economy.
- A Coveted Destination
In early 2022, MAS raised the barriers to entry by implementing a  minimum fund size of S$10 million and a plan to increase it to S$20 million in  2 years for family offices under Section 13O. 
It also requires those under Section 13U to invest a minimum of  10% of S$10 million of their funds, whichever is lower, in Singapore’s market.

Despite this, raising the bar has made setting  up a family office in Singapore more sought-after as it  distinguishes those with a higher net worth.

## The Trend of Wealthy Chinese Establishing Family Offices in Singapore  is Expected to Continue

As concerns about the future of China’s economy and political  stability persist, the trend of wealthy Chinese individuals establishing family  offices in Singapore is expected to continue.

These individuals, along with UHNWIs from other countries, are  increasingly looking to take advantage of the rising ASEAN economy and the  opportunities it offers for investment and business growth.

The growing number of family offices in Singapore reflects the  country’s attractiveness as a destination for wealth management.

Its stable financial system, favourable tax environment, and range  of professional services make it an appealing choice for those seeking to  manage and grow their wealth.

For wealthy Chinese individuals, establishing a family office in  Singapore can provide many benefits beyond just the financial.

In addition to the stability and expertise that Singapore offers  as a wealth management destination, many wealthy Chinese are also attracted to  the country for its high standard of living and strong education system.

The latter can be attractive for families seeking to provide a  better quality of life for their children.

Finally, Singapore has a diverse and multicultural society, which  can be attractive for those seeking a more open and inclusive environment.
