<!-- image -->

There comes a time when any business starts to think about expansion. Whether you are a fledgling business or earning healthy profits and looking to open up new avenues for revenue, international expansion could be your best course of action.

The best way to enter a foreign market is by working alongside a Professional Employer Organization- or PEO for short.

## What is a PEO?

A PEO can be useful for many business and recruitment situations. If you are expanding your company into a new market, they can help you hire local personnel without forming a legal entity in the country. A PEO will handle all of your employer’s responsibilities, such as Taxes, Accounting, and the HR Payroll.

This is a great way to save time and reduce costs. In fact, this is why many businesses choose to use our PEO services when expanding their business into another country. You do not have to worry about spending time on the employment process and worry about complex manpower regulations. You can continue your day-to-day management of the company and let the PEO take care of your personnel in the new country.

## Why are PEO Services needed for Business Expansion in Singapore?

Moving your business to Singapore is an enticing and potentially lucrative prospect. The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report declares Singapore as one of the top economies for sustaining inclusive growth. In fact, Singapore is seen by many companies as a gateway to the Southeast Asian market – an economy that consists of 600 million people spread across 10 countries. More than half of the 37,400 international companies have based their headquarters in Singapore, as it is easy to set up a business in the region.

If you want to minimize risk when moving to the Asia Pacific, you’ll want to hire a PEO that is familiar with the economic infrastructure.

This is where InCorp can help.
