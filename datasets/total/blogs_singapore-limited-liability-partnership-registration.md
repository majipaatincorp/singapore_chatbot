## Features of Limited Liability Company

## Advantages of Limited Liability Company

- It is a body corporate and has a legal personality separate from its partners
- It has perpetual succession. Any change in the partners of an LLP does not affect its existence, rights or liabilities
- Compliance requirements are simpler as compared to private limited company
- No annual returns filing is required of LLPs, except for income tax
- Partners not personally liable for debts and losses of LLP incurred by other partners

## Disadvantages of Limited Liability Company

- Profits taxed at partners’ personal income tax rates, therefore, not eligible for tax incentives or exemptions
- The partners of LLPs own the assets of the business personally, and therefore personally liable for debts and losses resulting from their own careless actions

## Compliance Requirements

- An LLP is obligated to maintain updated records to substantiate all transactions and its financial status. Failure to comply may result in prosecution and penalties.
- In Singapore, an LLP isn’t mandated to file or audit its accounts, nor disclose its capital.
- The manager of an LLP must annually declare solvency or insolvency to the Registrar, with the initial declaration within 15 months of LLP registration. Subsequently, an annual declaration must be made within intervals not exceeding 15 months.
- Every LLP must ensure that its invoices and official correspondence state its registration as an LLP, with the LLP’s name and registration number visibly printed on all bills, invoices, and official correspondence.
- Any changes to the LLP’s details must be reported to the Registrar within 14 days of the change.
