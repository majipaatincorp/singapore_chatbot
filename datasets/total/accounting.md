**The Key Components of Accounting and Finance Services**



**Financial Statements: Balance Sheet and Income Statement**

Financial statements are crucial in any business. They offer a transparent view of a company’s financial position and performance, which is crucial for correct tax filings and adherence to tax regulations. Not only does this information guide internal decision-making, but it also serves as vital input for external stakeholders.

Preparing comprehensive financial statements involves:

Maintaining complete and accurate accounting records, including the General Ledger, Fixed Asset listings, GST listings, and bank statements

Regular bank reconciliations

Recording, summarising, and reporting of financial transactions

Creating essential financial reports, such as balance sheets and income statements

**Compliance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS)**

InCorp specialises in guiding companies through SFRS compliance. They ensure that financial statements provide a true and fair view of a company’s financial position, as required under Singapore’s Companies Act. This includes maintaining essential records that support statutory reporting and help retrieve documents for tax filing and SFRS compliance.

**Accounting and Bookkeeping Services**

According to the Singapore Financial Reporting Standard (SFRS) rules, every Singapore company must maintain accurate financial reports that align with accounting standards. These records consist of:

A detailed Profit and Loss Account

A Balance Sheet showing the company’s financial health

A Cash Flow Statement monitoring the money coming in and going out

An Equity Statement illustrating changes in ownership

In addition, Singapore companies must carry out and adhere to local bookkeeping compliance requirements. For example, IRAS dictates that companies must keep proper records and accounts for 5 years with supporting documents, such as receipts and invoices.

As part of our **accounting and bookkeeping services in Singapore**, we are committed to the upkeep of your Book of Accounts, ensuring that they accurately represent the true financial state of your company. We help with financial reporting and analysis for various types of reporting periods, whether monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. 

**Accounting System Setup**

A robust and supported accounting system is important to perform accounting activities precisely. As part of our **accounting and bookkeeping management services**, we assist with implementing accounting systems, such as Xero, as well as staff training. Xero is a cloud-based accounting software that helps streamline financial performance and allows firms to obtain real-time insights into their financial performance.

It features a user-friendly interface and comprehensive segments that make it an ideal choice for easy management for any business owner.

**GST (Goods and Service Tax)**

GST applies to most goods imported into Singapore and the country’s supply of goods and services. It is a broad-based consumption tax designed to cover various transactions. At present, the prevailing GST rate is 9%.

We provide these GST-related services:

**GST Registration**

Singaporean businesses that expect or have experienced a taxable turnover exceeding S$1 million within 12 months must register for GST with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS).

Those entities are required to file GST returns every quarter. Note that any GST incurred by a company can be recovered as a claim from IRAS. Additionally, companies can voluntarily register for GST, even if their taxable supply does not exceed the required registration threshold.

**GST Submission and GST Returns**

GST-registered businesses are required to file GST returns, typically on a quarterly basis via the GST F5 form. The return includes details of the sales, purchases, GST collected on sales (output tax), and GST incurred on purchases (input tax).

GST returns and payments are due one month after the end of the accounting period covered by the return. Businesses must file their returns electronically through the IRAS’ myTax Portal. It is important to file the return and pay the GST due on time to avoid penalties and interest charges.

**GST Audit**

A GST audit is a review or examination of a business’s financial records and transactions to ensure compliance with the Singapore Goods and Services Tax (GST) laws and regulations. This process can be initiated by the tax authorities to verify the accuracy of GST returns filed by businesses. At InCorp, our GST audit service involves checking the accuracy of your company’s GST returns data to ensure compliance with statutory obligations.

**Audit Liaison**

An audit liaison serves as the crucial link between a company and its external auditors during the audit process. At InCorp, this process involves our accountants connecting with clients’ auditors to compile answers and clarifications for any queries raised on the books prepared. This often requires a deep understanding of the company’s operations, financial processes, and the specific areas under audit.

As the primary point of contact between the company and the external auditors, our accountants are responsible for facilitating clear, consistent, and effective communication, ensuring that both parties understand each other’s needs, questions, and responses.

**Drafting Services for Director’s Report**

All companies in Singapore must prepare and submit an Independent Auditor’s Report along with the Director’s Report as part of their statutory annual submission obligations. This requirement applies to companies with an annual revenue surpassing S$10 million, those with more than 20 individual shareholders, or any company with a corporate entity among its shareholders.

These reports are essential for a larger framework to foster strong financial governance. These bolster investor trust and protect shareholder interests by ensuring adherence to sound financial practices.

**Financial Statements in XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language)**

The majority of companies in Singapore must submit their financial statements in the XBRL format using the BizFinx filing system. It facilitates the efficient analysis of financial data. Its adoption in Singapore aims to enhance the clarity, dependability, and prompt distribution of financial information within the business sector.

**Payroll Services**

In Singapore, it is imperative for companies to prepare and process employees’ salaries on time and accurately to avoid facing heavy penalties. Therefore, having a reliable  and a competent professional to assist you will ensure that you stay compliant with local regulations.
