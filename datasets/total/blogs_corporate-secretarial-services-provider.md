Corporate service providers in Singapore are essential for foreigners seeking to set up a company in the city-state. Apart from assisting with company incorporation, they offer other services crucial for running a successful business in Singapore.

While some entrepreneurs may consider handling the tasks themselves, there are many benefits to engaging a professional corporate service provider. In this blog, we discuss why it makes more sense to engage a corporate services provider instead of performing the many business aspects yourself.

## What is a Corporate Secretarial Services Provider?

Many corporate service providers in Singapore differ based on their specialties and services. A corporate service provider aims to provide business support services to other companies, whether in tax accounting, company incorporation, or legal liabilities, performed through technology, experience, and well-thought-out practices that help the client.

Often, some companies choose to personally perform their corporate secretarial work. These tasks include filing paperwork manually or directly logging into the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA).

However, these activities are time-consuming and companies end up spending too much time and resources on them. This could distract the company from other functions of the business, thereby reducing value for the various stakeholders (employees, clients, etc).

To curb this problem, one may need a company well-versed in corporate secretarial work. Due to their strong expertise in operations, a reputable CSP can deliver services grounded in specific knowledge, skill sets, and the best operational practices.

In this, InCorp can bridge the gap by offering quality corporate secretarial services that are timely, accurate, and completely compliant with legal and regulatory standards.

## Why Engage a Corporate Secretarial Services Provider?

### 1. Managing Compliance Deadlines

In the world of corporate secretarial services, there are deadlines for everything. And if these deadlines are missed, financial penalties might be incurred. Certainly, these are unnecessary expenses that companies do not want.

However, with InCorp, this issue can easily be resolved. InCorp’s experts are experienced and profoundly understand the intricacies of various secretarial processes. Hence, to avoid these pesky penalties, we will track, monitor, and update the clients on all deadlines, giving them much-needed ease of mind.

### 2. Compliance Knowledge

Laws and regulations change here and there. For that reason, it can be tricky to constantly check these changes. Also, some companies may not have the manpower or industry knowledge to comprehend said changes.

Thus, if convoluted regulation changes leave you scratching your head, your saving grace may be approaching a corporate services provider like InCorp.

We consistently keep abreast of the latest regulatory changes. Our specialists have an in-depth knowledge of industry know-how. Additionally, InCorp will offer the best, most comprehensive advice to assist its clients in achieving complete compliance.

### 3. Transparent Pricing

Quality services should always be accompanied by transparent pricing. To build trust in clients, InCorp’s pricing is always transparent and forthcoming. Also, the quoted fees encompass the entire process, so the clients can feel confident knowing that they’re fully covered in various circumstances.

### 4. Validation

Corporate secretarial work is an ongoing process. Thus, understanding every aspect of this topic takes time; often, it also requires a certain level of expertise.

As such, rather than expecting the client to know everything, we aspire to communicate well with them. Furthermore, InCorp will validate the client’s viewpoints, understand what goals they’re trying to achieve, and turn those aspirations into actions.

### 5. One-stop Service

All of InCorp’s services cover clients from end to end. After providing all the relevant information, the clients can rest easy while InCorp takes care of all the paperwork. With the nitty-gritty out of the way, the client can focus on their business and valued customers. Rest assured, you are building a better company when you decide to outsource.

From the initial phases of deciding the business name to finding the appropriate corporate secretarial partner, a qualified firm could offer the service in a simple and straightforward way. This will remove the bulk of the unnecessary workload from managing a start-up, and even established businesses engage in corporate services to stay compliant with ACRA and assist their clients in the best way possible.

### 6. Professional Support

For a smooth and error-free process, one must have an expert and reliable team backing the efforts. In this context, a partnership with InCorp is ideal. After all, the team at InCorp is the best. Our specialists are highly qualified, accredited, and experienced. Above all, they are helpful and approachable.

Therefore, in a meeting with InCorp, no query is too small, and we endeavor to give our clients unrivaled, professional support.

### 7. Value-added services

The scope of corporate secretary work is vast and covers various aspects. To address this, InCorp offers a wide range of services. Furthermore, our specialists will customise the services according to each client’s needs to provide the best experience possible.

### 8. Saves Time

If you engage with professionals to operate your company, you will certainly save time. You will also be initiated into a network of associated experts and service providers such as accountants, management advisors, and lawyers by engaging in the services of a skilled service provider.

They have an in-depth understanding of niche fields that you may not find within your own business. A well-established service provider can assist even if you’re overseas and can help with finding potential investors and partners as well. This will save you time in a foreign country and quickly get your business off the ground.

Some companies need a 3rd party corporate company secretary

To become a company secretary, one must fulfill two requirements. First, the individual must reside locally in Singapore. Second, he or she must not be the sole director of the company.

Thus, businesses that cannot meet these criteria must outsource their corporate secretarial work to a licensed agency.
