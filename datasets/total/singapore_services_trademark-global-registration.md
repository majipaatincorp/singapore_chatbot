## Why Register A Trademark?

A trademark is a legal concept that refers to a symbol, word, phrase, or design that identifies and distinguishes a product or service from those offered by others. It is a powerful tool for businesses to protect their brand and reputation, and it is often considered one of the most valuable assets of a company.

Global Trademark Registration: Madrid Filing vs. Direct Filing
At InCorp, we assist our clients with both the Madrid Filing and Direct Filing options. Learn the key differences and identify which option is most suitable for your business below.




Madrid Filing*
Direct Filing




File a single application to cover multiple countries
File separate applications for each country


Based on an existing national or regional trademark application or registration
Does not require an existing national or regional trademark application or registration


Simplified and centralised process through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
Involves dealing with each country’s national trademark office


Can result in cost savings compared to filing separately in each country
Can provide greater flexibility and control over the filing process


Limited to countries that are members of the Madrid Protocol
Available to all countries, including non-Madrid Protocol countries


May have stricter examination and opposition procedures
Examination and opposition procedures may vary by country




* Note that under the Madrid Protocol System, before filing an international application, you must have first registered the trademark or filed an application domestically in the country of origin. A country of origin is a country that is a member of the Madrid Protocol where the applicant (person or entity filing the application) is a resident or national of or has a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment.
