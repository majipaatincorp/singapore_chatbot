In the new world of business, staying ahead of the curve often means embracing change, adapting to new regulations, and setting new standards.

One area where this is particularly evident is in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and climate reporting.

Singapore is making significant strides in this area to join the global effort to reduce carbon emissions through more sustainable practices — all while leveraging the benefits of a new green economy.

Let us delve deeper into what this means and why it matters to you and your business.

## Understanding Climate Reporting and its Relation to ESG

### Defining Climate Reporting

Climate reporting refers to the process by which companies disclose their environmental impact, particularly their greenhouse gas emissions.

This form of reporting is becoming increasingly important as stakeholders, including investors, customers, and regulators, demand greater transparency around companies’ environmental footprints.

### The Connection Between Climate Reporting and ESG

Climate reporting is a key component of ESG reporting, which covers a company’s environmental, social, and governance performance. ESG reporting goes beyond financial metrics to provide a more comprehensive view of a company’s long-term sustainability and societal impact.

Climate reporting, as part of the “Environmental” aspect of ESG, helps companies demonstrate their commitment to mitigating climate change.

## Why Climate Reporting Matters

### The Role of Climate Reporting in Business Sustainability

Climate reporting plays a crucial role in business sustainability. By measuring and disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions, companies can identify areas for improvement, set reduction targets, and monitor their progress.

This not only helps companies reduce their environmental impact but also enhances their reputation and can lead to cost savings.

### Climate Reporting as a Competitive Advantage

In an increasingly eco-conscious world, companies that transparently report their climate impact can gain a competitive edge.

Investors are more likely to support companies that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability, while consumers are increasingly favouring brands that take their environmental responsibilities seriously.

## Singapore’s Pioneering Role in Climate Reporting

### Singapore’s Recent Advancements in Climate Reporting

Singapore is at the forefront of climate reporting in Asia. The city-state’s regulatory bodies have put forth proposals to make climate-related disclosures mandatory for both public and large private companies.

This move aligns Singapore with international standards and positions it as a trendsetter in climate reporting in the region.

### Singapore’s Alignment with Global Standards

The planned disclosure rule would apply to companies with annual revenue of at least S$1 billion (US$750 million), starting in 2027. This aligns with guidelines laid out by the International Sustainability Standards Board, an independent body that sets global guidelines.

The advisory committee plans to conduct a review in 2027 to decide whether to expand the climate reporting requirements to unlisted companies with revenue of S$100 million (US$75 million) or more by around fiscal 2030.

## The Ripple Effects of Singapore’s Climate Reporting Regulations

### The Implications for Companies in Singapore

The new regulations will have significant implications for both listed and unlisted companies in Singapore. All listed issuers, overseas companies, REITs, and business trusts will be required to start climate reporting in 2025.

Non-listed companies with revenues of at least S$1 billion (US$750 million) will begin reporting in 2027. This move will ensure greater transparency and accountability in how businesses in Singapore are addressing climate change.

### The Future Landscape of Climate Reporting in Singapore

The future of climate reporting in Singapore looks promising — with the new regulations, the city-state is set to become a leader in climate reporting in Asia. This will enhance Singapore’s reputation as a global business hub and encourage other countries in the region to follow suit.

## Singapore’s Climate Reporting Move: A Step Towards Becoming a Sustainability Centre

### Singapore’s Green Plan 2030 and its Impact on Climate Reporting

The mandatory climate reporting is part of Singapore’s Green Plan 2030, which aims to advance the city-state’s national agenda on sustainable development.

The plan underscores Singapore’s commitment to the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and its transition to a green economy. The introduction of mandatory climate reporting will further bolster this commitment.

### Singapore’s Contribution to Global Sustainability Efforts

By making climate reporting mandatory, Singapore is making a significant contribution to global sustainability efforts. The move sends a strong signal to the rest of the world about the importance of transparency and accountability in tackling climate change.

At the same time, it positions Singapore as a role model for other countries looking to enhance their climate reporting regulations.

## Preparing for the Future of Climate Reporting

### The Role of Businesses in Climate Reporting

Businesses play a crucial role in climate reporting — by measuring and disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions, they can contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change. Moreover, climate reporting can help businesses identify risks and opportunities related to climate change, enabling them to make more informed decisions and strategies.

### The Benefits of Adapting to Climate Reporting Regulations

Adapting to climate reporting regulations can bring numerous benefits for businesses — it can enhance their reputation, attract investment, and lead to cost savings. Furthermore, it can help businesses stay competitive in an increasingly eco-conscious market.
