# Why is Singapore a Prime Spot for Top-Tier Foreign Talent?

<!-- image -->

The island nation of Singapore has long been a powerhouse in the  global economy, and its status as a premier destination for top-tier talent is  no exception.

According to a new study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and The  Network, this reputation has been bolstered, as Singapore has risen 10 places  to become the 8th most attractive location for global talent.

Welcome news to Singapore’s existing business community, the  study’s release couldn’t have come at a more critical time — as the world  economy slowly emerges from the shadow of COVID-19.

## Singapore Maintains its Lead as a Foreign Talent Hub

The pandemic has led to a dramatic shift in attitudes among  professionals globally, with many now reluctant to move abroad for work.

But despite this, the island nation has continued to attract top  talent from around the world — thanks in part to its proactive and successful  response to COVID-19.

While many of the traditionally attractive destinations such as  New York, Barcelona, and Rome have seen their reputations suffer due to the  pandemic, Singapore has emerged unscathed — even enhancing its appeal as a  business destination.

This is largely due to the fact that Singapore was one of the  first countries to implement strict measures to control the spread of COVID-19  within its borders.

These measures, which included a mandatory 14-day quarantine for  all incoming travellers and a nationwide mask mandate, proved to be highly  effective.

As a result, Singapore was able to avoid the worst of the  pandemic. At the time of writing, there are no longer any traveller  restrictions beyond a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test.

## Why Does Singapore Need Foreign Talent?

Singapore has a lack of its own talent in the local workforce. By  getting international talent to live and work here, it can build up its local  talent, encouraging them to stay and help foster a dynamic and outstanding  nation.

In addition, the Lion City is also a highly attractive destination  for global companies to invest and expand their businesses here.

These corporations require human talent to assist in their  operations as well, which contributes to the ever-increasing demand for capable  and skilled workers.

## Why is Singapore an Ideal Destination for Foreign Talent?

There are, of course, many existing reasons why talents from  around the world have chosen to further their careers in Singapore — including  its favourable tax policies for talent, supportive government, and famous  liveability.

Let us look at these reasons in greater detail:

### A Favourable Income Tax System

Singapore’s favourable income  tax policies for talent have always been a huge  incentive for employees and employers alike.

Under Singapore’s tax system, foreign professionals can enjoy a  15% tax rate on their first S$160,000 of taxable income.

This is significantly lower than the rates in many other developed  countries — making Singapore an attractive destination for high-earners and  experts in their fields.

### One of World’s Most Liveable Cities

Singapore is also a highly attractive place to live, as the  city-state has consistently ranked as one of the most liveable cities in the world.

It is recognised for its low crime rates, excellent healthcare  system, and an extensive array of public spaces.

This makes Singapore an ideal destination for expats and their  families who are looking for a safe and comfortable place to call home.

### A Supportive Government

The small city-state understands the need to bolster its efforts  in attracting global talent to build a world-class talent pool.

Apart from the incentives it has implemented, Singapore also has a  variety of work  passes that enable foreigners to work here.

During the National Day Rally Speech held on 21 Aug, Prime  Minister Lee Hsien Loong first hinted at new initiatives to make leading talent  seriously consider coming to Singapore.

On 29 Aug, the new Overseas  Networks and Expertise (ONE) Pass, Singapore’s newest upcoming work pass aimed at the best international talents, was revealed.

It comes with several benefits, like a 5-year validity and  outstanding job flexibility. Foreign workers can also look at the other work  passes available, such as the Personalised Employment  Pass (PEP) and Tech.Pass.

## Singapore is Not Forgetting Its Local Talent Either

Despite its continued efforts to entice foreign talents, Singapore  has not forgotten about its local workers.

It has schemes like the TeSA  Mid-Career Advance programme and the SkillsFuture  Leadership Development Initiative that  ensure Singaporeans can develop their talents and upgrade their skills for a  competitive local jobs market.

Singapore also introduced the Complementarity Assessment Framework  (COMPASS) which will kick in in 2023. This points-based Employment Pass (EP)  system is geared towards expertise in short-supply firms with vibrant workers  and businesses supporting local employment.

## A Continued Push to Attract the World’s Best Foreign Talent

The global fight for the world’s leading talent is dynamic and an  on-going battle, which means that the country has to continue improving its  efforts.

With the world slowly returning to normal, it is likely that  Singapore will continue to attract global talent from around the globe as it  continues to evolve towards its goal of becoming the world’s leading  city.

So, if you’re looking for an exciting and safe place to live and  work, Singapore should definitely be at the top of your list.

With its world-class infrastructure, strong economy, and welcoming  attitude towards talent, it’s easy to see why Singapore is one of the most  attractive destinations for global talent.
