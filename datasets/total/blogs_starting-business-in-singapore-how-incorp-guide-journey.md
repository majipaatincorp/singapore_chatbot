If you are reading this, you are likely considering Singapore as a home for your next business. Your hunch that Singapore could be an ideal base for your venture is well-founded amongst your fellow entrepreneurs — in 2022 alone, Singapore experienced a net increase of 64,000 new businesses.

So, why all this desire to do business in Singapore? What makes it such a magnet for entrepreneurs and companies worldwide? One reason is its status as the world’s freest economy, which it has recently surpassed Hong Kong in.

This distinction is based on the Lion City’s exceptional ability to promote international trade, its openness to market competition, and its favourable business regulations.

On the ground, this translates into a highly developed and successful free-market economy, characterised by openness, minimal corruption, stable prices, and a per capita GDP that surpasses that of many developed nations.

These factors undoubtedly contribute to why entrepreneurs like yourself are drawn to Singapore. At InCorp, we understand the allure, but crucially, we also understand the challenges.

Our continuous study of the ever-evolving Singaporean business landscape and our relentless pursuit of business optimisation have empowered hundreds of aspiring entrepreneurs like yourself to achieve exceptional results — as proven by our client testimonials.

This article will share those lessons and explore how InCorp’s tailored services can streamline the process of business registration, ensuring a smooth and successful entry into Singapore’s thriving economic landscape.

From legal incorporation to strategic business advisory, we will cover the essential steps and services that can help you maximise your business’s potential in Singapore.

## 1. Starting a Business in Singapore: Simplifying the Essentials

InCorp simplifies the process of establishing your business in Singapore, guiding you through every step of incorporation — from selecting the right business structure to navigating legal requirements.

When it comes to the business entity, whether you are setting up a private limited company, a limited liability partnership, or a sole proprietorship, our expertise ensures that your business meets all regulatory obligations from the outset.

Different entities have unique features that you need to understand – for example, a private limited company has a separate legal entity from its owners, making it an attractive choice.

### Streamlined Singapore Company Registration Process

While Singapore’s pro-business environment is designed to offer a smooth and efficient incorporation process, it is a stringent procedure. InCorp’s services include handling registration documents, advising on the suitable business structure, and ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations. Our experienced team can even assist in setting up your corporate bank account, making the entire process seamless.

### Handling Legal Requirements

We manage the necessary registrations with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and ensure that your business adheres to all statutory compliance requirements. This includes everything from the initial application for a company name to the submission of incorporation documents and the payment of registration fees.

### The InCorp Advantage

By partnering with InCorp for your business incorporation, you gain more than just expert advice. You leverage our comprehensive on-the-ground understanding of Singapore’s business landscape, ensuring a smooth and successful setup of your business operations.

## 2. Secretarial &amp; Compliance: Essential Support for Your Business in Singapore

At InCorp, we understand that your focus is (and should be) on growing your business. That’s why our secretarial and compliance services are designed to handle the critical, yet often cumbersome, regulatory details that are essential for your operational success in Singapore.

We do more than just ensure compliance; our company secretary services integrate it seamlessly into your business operations, allowing you to concentrate on what matters most — your business goals.

### Tailored Compliance Solutions

Our secretarial and compliance services are by no means one-size-fits-all. We offer customised solutions that fit the unique needs of your business, whether you are a startup needing initial setup guidance or an established multinational dealing with complex corporate governance.

We handle routine compliance such as statutory filings and annual returns, and we’re always prepared to manage more complex requirements that come with business growth and changes.

### The InCorp Advantage

## 4. Taxation in Singapore: Simplify With InCorp

While Singapore’s tax system is designed to be entrepreneur-friendly with one of the lowest burdens globally, it is also stringent in its adherence requirements.

Beyond compliance, without expert guidance, you might miss out on valuable tax benefits and incentives specifically available to enhance business growth and efficiency. InCorp is here to ensure that you fully leverage these opportunities while maintaining rigorous compliance with all tax laws.

### Expert Tax Services Tailored to You

At InCorp, we tailor our tax services to meet your specific needs, ensuring that your Singapore business benefits fully from Singapore’s tax-efficient environment.

### The InCorp Advantage

We pride ourselves on being up-to-the-minute with the latest tax changes to provide strategic advice that directly supports your business objectives, helping you to capitalise on every available incentive and deduction. This proactive approach ensures you’re always ahead, financially and strategically.

## 5. Immigration in Singapore: Ensuring Compliance and Access to Global Talent

While Singapore consistently ranks as one of the most attractive places to live for expats and its immigration process is more streamlined than in many other countries, the system remains stringent. Adhering to its precise requirements is crucial for businesses looking to secure the best in global talent.

### The InCorp Advantage

Understanding the importance of a diverse and skilled workforce, InCorp tailors immigration strategies to fit your business needs. We manage all facets of the immigration process, from initial applications to renewals and appeals, ensuring that your team members arrive ready to contribute with minimal delays.
