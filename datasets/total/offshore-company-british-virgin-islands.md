**Why Should You Open a BVI Company?**

Situated in the Atlantic Ocean 96km east of Puerto Rico with a population of 31,305 as of 2022, the British Virgin Islands has been a famed jurisdiction for offshore company setups and corporate trusts for the past three decades.

Its emergence as an offshore financial centre began with the establishment of the International Business Companies Act of 1984, which led to the creation of International Business Companies (IBCs) in its territories.

Since then, over 750,000 offshore companies have been incorporated, with IBCs being the de facto business unit for foreign companies and individuals wanting to incorporate a BVI company.
