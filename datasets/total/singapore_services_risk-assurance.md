## Importance of Risk Assurance

In the ever-evolving business landscape, organisations must proactively address potential threats and meet stakeholder expectations. Our Risk Assurance Services are positioned to assist organisations in mitigating risks and safeguarding business operations.

Our valuable insights and recommendations strengthen internal controls, enhance risk management processes, and protect assets. In this way, we help businesses achieve their strategic objectives while maintaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

## Internal Audit

The role of internal audit is an independent, objective, and consulting activity designed to add value to and improve an organisation’s operations.

At InCorp, we provide a digital audit experience by employing data analytics and visualisation tools to provide greater business insights through descriptive analysis to our clients.

### Value-Adding 5-Part Internal Audit Report

Our Internal Audit Report comprises the following five components, which include Data Analytics Insights, Positive Controls, and Good Practices, Opportunities for Improvements, and Best-fit and Curated Sample Templates:

#### Data Analytics Insights

Using our Audit Tools, we share Business Insights and Data Visuals with the management, in addition to using the Audit Tools to adopt a Risk-Based Audit Approach and Targeted Testing for our internal audit.

#### Positive Controls and Good Practices

We distinguish our audit reports by including the Positive Controls and Good Practices that we observe during the course of our audit work so that our report presents a balanced output.

#### Main Audit Observations

We will identify non-conformance, gaps, risks, and potential implications in the processes and procedures and make recommendations to improve internal controls.

Focus on Root Cause Analysis:

- People
- Process
- System

#### Opportunities for Improvement

We will identify Opportunities for Improvement in terms of efficiency, economy, and effectiveness and provide reasonable and practical recommendations.

#### Best-fit and Curated Sample Templates

We will provide Best-fit and Curated Sample Templates to assist management in effectively implementing the proposed management action plans.

## Risk Management

Risk management is the process of identifying and addressing the potential events that represent risks to achieving strategic objectives or opportunities to gain a competitive advantage.

We advise organisations on the steps to take to ensure that their business is in a strong position to fight against any risks threatening their organisations.
