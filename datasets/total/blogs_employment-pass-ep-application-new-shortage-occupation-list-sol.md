There is no secret about  Singapore’s thirst for talent — the city-state is going through its most significant  talent shortage in 16 years, with 84% of  companies in Singapore reporting talent shortages.

The new Complementarity  Assessment Framework (COMPASS) and Shortage Occupation List (SOL) are vital in  Singapore’s efforts to attract and retain foreign talent, addressing skills  gaps in various sectors.

Applying for a Singapore  Employment Pass (EP) is the most common way for foreign professionals and  executives to work in Singapore, and the SOL brings several changes to the EP  application process.

Let us take a look at the  implications for businesses, and how the new COMPASS framework will be implemented.

## How Will  the COMPASS Framework Affect EP Applications?

The COMPASS framework  kicks in on 1 Sept 2023. What is this upcoming framework about, and how will it  affect EP applicants?

### Objectives  and Benefits

The COMPASS framework is  an excellent tool for Singapore employers seeking to attract high-quality  foreign professionals while simultaneously strengthening the local  workforce.

The framework’s emphasis  on complementarity and diversity can help businesses build a robust core team  with a broad range of skills and knowledge, ensuring long-term success in a  highly competitive global market.

Furthermore, the  transparent and predictable system provides businesses with greater clarity and  certainty in manpower planning, making it easier to identify the right  candidates for their workforce needs.

Overall, the  implementation of the COMPASS framework is a step in the right direction for  Singapore’s employment landscape.

### Key  Components

COMPASS comprises a  revised EP eligibility and a points-based system. 40 points are required to  pass COMPASS and are allocated to the four foundational criteria as in the  image below.

|                       | Individual Attributes                                     | Firm-Related Attributes                                                         |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Foundational Criteria | Salary                                                    | Diversity                                                                       |
| Foundational Criteria | Pegged to average PMET salary for industry                | Candidate has to enhance nationality diversity in the company                   |
| Foundational Criteria | Qualifications                                            | Support for Local Employment                                                    |
| Foundational Criteria | Applicant’s qualifications                                | Pegged to local PMET share relative to industry peers                           |
| Bonus Criteria        | Skills Bonus (Shortage Occupation List)                   | Strategic Economic Priorities Bonus                                             |
| Bonus Criteria        | Applies to candidates with jobs that have skill shortages | For government partnerships for aspiring innovation or globalisation activities |

Each criterion is scored  as:

- 20 points – exceeds expectations
- 10 points – meets expectations
- 0 points – does not meet       expectations

Applications that meet  expectations (earning 10 points each) for salary, qualifications, diversity,  and support for local employment will pass COMPASS requirements.

If these criteria points  do not meet 40 points, the applicant will need to make up the required points  by exceeding expectations in other criteria or gaining bonus points in the  bonus criteria of skills bonus (for a job in the SOL), or strategic economic priorities  bonus.

## The New Shortage  Occupation List (SOL)

The Singapore government  has created a Shortage Occupation List (SOL) that will kick in together with  the introduction of the COMPASS framework.

### Purpose  of the SOL

The SOL aims to identify  roles in high demand and with insufficient local workforce supply, making it  easier for businesses to fill these positions with foreign talent.

These roles receive bonus  points during the EP application process, facilitating a smoother recruitment  process for employers. It is designed to go together with efforts in growing  Singapore’s local graduate pipeline.

### Roles  Included

The SOL  comprises 27 shortage roles across various sectors, including information and  communications technology, life sciences, and financial services. A complete  list can be found on MOM’s website.

## Adapting to the New  COMPASS Framework

How can businesses adapt  to the new COMPASS framework, especially for those looking to hire? Navigating  the new system may be unfamiliar to employers who are unsure of its effects.  Here are some actions they could take:

### Reviewing  Current Employment Pass Holders

Businesses should begin  reviewing their existing EP holders to ensure they meet the new salary  requirements and other eligibility criteria under the COMPASS framework. This  will help employers prepare for any potential challenges during the EP renewal  process.

### Adapting  Recruitment Strategies

With the new framework’s  emphasis on complementarity, employers may need to revise their recruitment  strategies to focus on foreign candidates who can meet the new criteria.

This may involve adjusting  job advertisements, interview processes, and onboarding procedures to align  with the new guidelines.

### Compliance  With New Regulations

Employers must ensure they  comply with all new regulations under the COMPASS framework, including accurate  reporting of salary, qualifications, and job roles during the EP application  process.

Non-compliance may result  in penalties or rejection of EP applications, so it’s important to get this  right.

| Criteria             | Old Framework                    | New Framework                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Eligibility Criteria | Minimum salary    requirement    | Two-stage eligibility    framework                                                             |
| Stage 1              | Meeting the qualifying    salary | Points-based assessment    for salary, qualifications, diversity, support for local employment |
| Stage 2              | N/A                              | Bonus points for skills    bonus (SOL) and strategic economic priorities bonus                 |
| Application Date     | Before September 1, 2023         | From September 1, 2023                                                                         |

Your internal team may  well be equipped to undertake these new changes, but if required, talk to a  professional services provider who is familiar with these changes, such as  InCorp.

Again, non-compliance may  result in penalties or rejection of EP applications, so in-depth knowledge will  be a necessity.
