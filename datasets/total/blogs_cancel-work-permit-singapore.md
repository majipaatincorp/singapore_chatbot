For foreign workers and expats in Singapore, work permit cancellation is a crucial process. As an employer, you are required to assist them in this procedure, whether by performing the cancellation yourself or through an employment agent like InCorp.

We take you through the various aspects of cancelling your employee’s work permit in this blog to ensure that you have a better understanding of the compliance issues to note.

## Can a Work Permit Be Cancelled?

If an employee no longer works for you or when the work permit expires, the work permit must be cancelled. It must be cancelled within 1 week from the last day of notice.

### Exemptions From Work Permit Cancellation

In certain situations, you need not cancel your worker’s work permit. Specifically, you do not need to do so if:

- The work permit holder becomes a Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR)
- The pass has expired. If the pass holder remains in Singapore, you must ask for a Special Pass to provide them with a valid stay in Singapore; failure to do so will lead to an overstaying fine

## What to Do Before Cancelling a Work Permit

As an employer, you must perform these tasks before you cancel your worker’s work permit:

- Give your worker reasonable notice on the repatriation back home
- Obtain tax clearance from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) at least 1 month before your worker’s final employment date
- Ensure that all outstanding employment issues that your worker may raise are settled, including salary payments
- Make sure that your worker has a valid passport
- Discuss and have a written agreement with your worker on these aspects before buying an air ticket:
    - Transit arrangements such as connecting flights and the layover duration
    - The allowance your worker needs to sustain themselves during the transit
- Buy an air ticket with check-in baggage and pay for connecting transport costs to the international entry port in your worker’s home country or region closest to their hometown. Your worker must depart Singapore within 2 weeks from the work permit cancellation

An employee can remain in Singapore for the duration of the Special Pass, which lasts for up to 14 days. Employers are reminded that the worker must depart Singapore before the Special Pass expires.

### What Are the Consequences of Overstaying?

Overstaying in Singapore may lead to an overstaying fine being imposed. It is also a criminal offence for foreigners to remain in Singapore after a visa’s expiry date and for companies to hire workers without a valid work pass.

## What Should Employees Do Before Leaving Singapore Permanently?

There are several things that a worker should settle beforehand, should they decide to leave Singapore permanently. For example, employers must seek tax clearance on their behalf. You must inform IRAS and hold on to the payments due to your worker from the date of the employment cessation notice, or the date of employment termination.

After IRAS carries out an assessment and issues a tax clearance certificate to verify your employee’s tax payment, you must release the payment due. It typically takes up to 21 days to perform a tax clearance, and IRAS may appoint your employee’s bank to act as an agent for tax recovery purposes.

If your employee has overdue taxes, they may be stopped from leaving Singapore through a stop order certification. If this happens, your employee may need to get a release letter from IRAS.
