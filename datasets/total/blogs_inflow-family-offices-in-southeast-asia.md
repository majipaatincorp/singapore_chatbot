# What’s Fuelling the Inflow of Family Offices in Southeast Asia?

<!-- image -->

According to Knight Frank, the forecast growth of the HNW and ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW)’s population in Asia will be the fastest worldwide.

This can be supported by the increase in its UHNW population – 7.2% from 2020 to 2021 to 170,000, which is predicted to rise to 225,000 by 2026. Likewise, the high net worth (HNW) population in the Asia Pacific hit 7.2 million in 2021, representing a 4.2% annual increase.

In Southeast Asia, family offices are becoming increasingly popular as more and more wealthy individuals and high net worth families look for asset management methods and protect their interests.

These offices can provide a wide range of services. They can also be a great way for families to stay together and keep communication open.

Let us delve deeper into the growing establishment of many family offices in the region.

## What is a Family Office?

A family office is a professional investment management firm that provides services to a single wealthy family, or on behalf of the ultimate principal.

The firm engages industry experts, from investment professionals to legal and insurance veterans to manage financial and legal affairs for the family.

Family offices often provide estate planning, tax advice, succession planning, and other consulting services. They may even perform lifestyle management, which includes travel arrangements and catering to their lifestyle requirements.

### What Are the Types of Family Offices Available?

- Single family offices with one principal (serve a single family)
- Multi family offices (serve a few families and multiple family members for economies of scale)

### Are Family Offices or Hedge Funds Better?

While both are wealth management tools, family offices offer a full suite of financial planning services. On the other hand, hedge funds only help to invest money.

## What Are Some Benefits of Setting Up a Family Office?

Why are family offices attractive to those looking to manage their family wealth?

### Improved Decision-Making

By having a dedicated team that is focused solely on managing the family’s assets, family offices can improve decision-making and execution.

### Greater Efficiency

Family offices can help to streamline operations and reduce costs.

### Enhanced Privacy

Family offices can provide a higher level of privacy and confidentiality than traditional investment firms.

### Greater Control

Family offices can give families more control over their investments and better alignment of interests between investors and managers.

This is a boon because of the rising preference of wealthy families wanting to be more involved in managing their financial assets.

### Simpler Structures Over Complex Traditional Vehicles

It was customary for wealthy families to hold their investments via holding firms or special purpose vehicles (SPVs). However, the complexity of these traditional vehicles made management difficult and troublesome.

Today, simpler structures are family office principals’ preferred choices, and the typical creation of a family fund alongside a family office helps to house all financial assets and SPVs.

This leads to a simpler, more efficient, and transparent holding structure.

## Why is the Number of Family Offices in Southeast Asia Growing?

There are several factors that have contributed to the growth of family offices in this region.

First, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of high-net-worth (HNW) individuals in Southeast Asia in recent years.

Second, the economies of many countries in the region are growing rapidly, providing new opportunities for investment.

And third, the regulatory environment is becoming more conducive to private wealth management.

Let us look at how each of these factors is driving the growth of family offices in Southeast Asia:

### A Significant Increase in HNW Individuals in SEA

The number of high-net-worth individuals (HNW) in Southeast Asia is growing rapidly, providing a fertile ground for family offices.

This growth is being fueled by rising incomes and rapid economic expansion in countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.

In addition, the development of new wealth management products and services is attracting more investors and affluent business families to the region.

The growth of family offices in Southeast Asia is likely to continue as more wealthy families look for ways to manage their wealth and protect their interests.

### Rapid Economic Growth

In Southeast Asia, the rapid economic growth is fueling the influx of family offices. This is due to the increase of high-net-worth individuals in SEA and the development of new wealth management products and services.

In addition, many of the region’s HNW individuals are young and have benefited from the region’s strong economic growth over the past few years.

As a result, they have more disposable income to invest in, which is fuelling the growth of family offices.

### Conducive Regulatory Environment

Some countries in Southeast Asia have developed a more conducive regulatory environment for private wealth management, making it easier for family offices to operate.

For example, in Singapore, there are no restrictions on the amount of money that can be managed by a family office, and there are a number of tax incentives available for investors.

The Philippines has also developed a number of regulations to support family offices, including the recently-introduced Family Office Act.

This act sets out the rules and regulations for family offices in the country and provides a number of benefits such as reduced taxes and simplified reporting requirements.

Other countries in the region are also developing similar regulations, which is likely to further spur the growth of family offices in Southeast Asia.

## Is Singapore Ready for the Rise of Family Offices?

As a leading financial hub in the region, it is no surprise that there is a rapid increase in the number of family offices in Singapore.

In the first 4 months of 2022, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had already approved over 100 applications to set up family offices.

There are a number of reasons why Singapore is an attractive choice for family offices:
