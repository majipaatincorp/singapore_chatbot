<!-- image -->

When it comes to tax evasion, Singapore has very strict laws and regulations, making it a serious criminal offence with stringent penalties for the offenders. While most Singapore taxpayers readily comply with the law, some businesses and individuals try to evade taxes using unlawful means.

In this article, we discuss critical areas of tax evasion in Singapore, including the penalties, the legal framework, and the difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance. We also highlight how the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) enforces tax laws and offers practical advice for companies to avoid foul of the law. This underscores the importance of Singapore tax audits to avoid tax fraud.

## Key Points

- Tax evasion in Singapore is a serious criminal offence that involves illegal actions such as under-reporting income and falsifying documents. Penalties under Singapore tax laws include fines of up to 400% of the additional tax payable and imprisonment of up to five years in certain severe cases.
- While tax evasion is illegal, tax avoidance in Singapore legally minimises tax liability. The IRAS strictly enforces tax compliance in the country as it differentiates the two practices, ensuring both companies and individuals follow the regulations.
- IRAS plays a key role in tackling Singapore income tax evasion through tax audits, investigations, and international cooperation. This is to ensure that all taxes are accurately reported and paid.
- Companies must implement robust measures to prevent tax evasion in Singapore, including conducting regular audits, educating employees on tax compliance, and maintaining accurate records to avoid penalties and legal repercussions.

## Understanding Tax Evasion in Singapore

Tax evasion involves deliberately avoiding paying taxes through illegal practices such as under-reporting income, inflating deductions, or failing to report income. Both corporate tax evasion and individual tax evasion in Singapore are considered criminal offences under the Income Tax Act and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Act.

The most common forms of Singapore tax evasion include:

- Under-reporting Income: Declaring less income than what was earned.
- Inflating Deductions or Expenses: Claiming deductions or expenses that were not incurred.
- Falsifying Documents: Creating false invoices or records to reduce taxable income.
- Using Phantom Employees: Reporting non-existent employees to claim wage-related tax deductions.

Tax evasion is established when the IRAS determines that a Singapore taxpayer intentionally violated tax laws. Hence, companies in Singapore should be vigilant of tax audits and financial reports to ensure tax compliance. Although small acts of carelessness or negligence in tax reporting are not classified as evasions, they are still serious enough to cause you penalties.

## Legal Framework and Singapore Tax Evasion Penalties

Singapore has a robust legal framework to combat tax evasion, with severe penalties reserved for those found guilty. The Singapore income tax evasion penalties vary according to the severity of the offence. It includes fines, imprisonment, repayment of taxes, and additional penalties.

### Penalties for Errors in Tax Returns With Intention to Evade Taxes:

- Up to 200% of the tax undercharged
- Fine of up to S$5,000
- Imprisonment of up to three years

### Penalties for Errors in Tax Returns With Intention to Evade Taxes:

- Up to 400% of the tax undercharged

### Penalties for Serious Fraudulent Tax Evasion

- Fine of up to S$50,000: For cases involving falsified documents, fines can go up to S$50,000.
- Imprisonment of up to seven years: Severe cases involving falsification of records may lead to imprisonment for up to seven years.

## Tax Evasion vs. Tax Avoidance in Singapore

Foreign investors and entrepreneurs doing business in Singapore must differentiate between tax avoidance and tax evasion to avoid potential tax fraud. While they might sound the same, they are fundamentally different in the eyes of the Singapore tax authorities as per the tax laws of the country.

### Tax Avoidance in Singapore

According to Singapore tax laws, the practice of tax avoidance involves legally minimising tax liabilities through different methods. This includes claiming allowable deductions, utilising tax credits, and taking advantage of tax incentives. While tax avoidance in Singapore is legal, the IRAS can scrutinise companies and individuals for indulging in aggressive tax avoidance strategies.

### Tax Evasion in Singapore

In contrast, tax evasion in Singapore involves illegal activities to reduce tax liabilities, such as hiding income or falsifying records. Tax evasion is a criminal offence and is treated with the utmost seriousness by Singapore tax authorities.

## IRAS Tax Evasion Enforcement Measures

When it comes to enforcing tax evasion measures, IRAS is the highest compliance authority. The IRAS strictly follows the Singapore tax laws and ensures every taxpayer complies with them. The agency has tax evasion detection systems in place for thorough scrutiny. The procedure involves detailed IRAS investigations, tax audits, and cooperation and coordination with international tax authorities wherever needed.

### Key IRAS Enforcement Strategies

- Singapore Tax Audits: IRAS conducts regular tax audits to identify discrepancies in tax filings. Businesses and individuals who exhibit unusual or suspicious tax reporting behaviour are more likely to be audited.
- Singapore IRAS Investigations: In cases where there is strong evidence of tax evasion, IRAS conducts thorough investigations, which can result in prosecution.
- International Cooperation: Singapore is part of global efforts to combat tax evasion, which includes information exchange agreements with other countries to track cross-border tax evasion.

## Corporate Responsibility: Preventing Tax Evasion

Companies in Singapore must be vigilant in ensuring compliance with tax laws. Failure to do so can result in significant Singapore tax evasion penalties, not just for the company but also for individual employees found to be part of such tax evasion activities.

### Steps for Companies to Avoid Tax Evasion in Singapore

To prevent Singapore tax fraud, foreign investors and entrepreneurs operating businesses in the country should take the following steps:

1. Conduct Regular Audits: Regular internal audits and financial report preparation can help identify and rectify potential tax issues before they escalate. Hence, Singaporean companies need to do monthly, quarterly, and yearly financial statements and audits. This helps in Singapore tax compliance and keeps the company’s finances sorted as you regularly tally the expenses and revenue. Ultimately, it can lead to enhanced business operations and performance as it becomes easier for you to deal with bottlenecks and problem areas.
Employee Training: Ensure employees are well-versed in Singapore tax laws and the severe consequences of tax evasion in the country. This is crucial for Singapore tax compliance and for the overall well-being of the individuals, as it saves them from possible financial burdens arising from negligent tax filing.
Clear Reporting Channels: Encourage employees to report any suspicious activities or concerns related to tax compliance. This also ensures that the individuals get proper benefits as per the  Singapore tax laws.
Document Retention: Maintain accurate and thorough records to support tax filings and audits. This process helps address inconsistencies, allowing businesses to identify and rectify gaps or errors in tax filings through regular audits and financial reviews. Repeated tax filing mistakes or non-compliance issues can lead to heavy penalties and suspension of your business activities in certain cases.
Distinguish Between Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion: Educate staff on the legal differences between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Mixing up the two can result in under-reporting incomes and wrongful tax filing, which causes financial strain on the company.
Screen Partners and Clients: Companies in Singapore should conduct due diligence on potential business partners and clients to avoid entanglement in their tax issues. This prevents you from being implicated in tax fraud by your clients and partners.

By following the above steps, businesses can avoid issues related to corporate tax evasion in Singapore as they take care of all the avenues where such fraud and tax non-compliance can occur, including clients, partners, and employees.
