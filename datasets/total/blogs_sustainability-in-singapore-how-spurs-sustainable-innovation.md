<!-- image -->

As the world starts to see the tangible effects of global warming,  even the most skeptical among us are beginning to acknowledge the urgency of sustainability.

As businesses, we have always been driven by growth. While  sustainability has traditionally been low on the priority list for corporate  growth, in recent years, it has become a key driver of development for  companies worldwide.

Given that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) focused  assets are projected to grow to US$50  trillion by 2025, it is clear that the  business case for sustainable innovation has never been stronger.

## What is Sustainable Innovation?

Most of us are familiar with the concept of innovation. After all,  it is the lifeblood of any economy looking to compete in the global  marketplace. But what exactly is sustainable innovation?

Simply put, sustainable innovation is creating value for society  while minimising environmental impact. It is about designing products,  services, and business models that protect the planet for future generations.

Apart from confronting the necessities of a green future,  sustainable innovation is also driven by growing consumer demand for goods and  services created with environmental sustainability in mind.

Consumers are increasingly conscious of the environmental and  social impacts of their purchasing decisions, and they are willing to pay more  for products and services that positively affect the world.

This represents a huge opportunity for businesses to tap into a  lucrative market while also doing good for the planet. To tap into this market  of immense potential, they need to innovate.

## Why is Sustainable Innovation Important?

There are 3 main reasons why sustainable innovation is important  for businesses:

### Critical Growth Driver

The first reason is that it is a key growth driver. To stay  competitive in the global marketplace, businesses need to innovate. And  sustainable innovation presents a vast untapped market of opportunities for  companies to explore.

### Managing Risk

The second reason is risk management. As the effects of climate  change become more apparent, businesses need to start incorporating  sustainability into their risk management strategies.

By making sustainability a key part of their operations,  businesses can protect themselves against potential disruptions to their supply  chains and reputational damage from being seen as irresponsible corporate  citizens.

### The Right Thing to Do

The third reason is that sustainable innovation is simply the  right thing to do. We are all responsible for leaving the planet in a better  state for future generations. Businesses are in a unique position to make a  positive impact on the world through their products and services.

## How is Singapore Fostering Sustainable Innovation?

With its usual foresight, the city-state’s government has seen the  importance of sustainable innovation.

The country has already been taking early measures on sustainable  development, such as:

- Switching       from fuel to natural gas to create electricity
- Establishing       its goal to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles that use petrol       and diesel to electric vehicles by 2040
- The       creation of green buildings and to have more than 80% of buildings in       Singapore to be green by 2030

Its US$133 million Enterprise Sustainability Programme (ESP),  managed by the Singapore government agency, Enterprise Singapore, is driving  businesses to develop sustainable solutions.

The ESP is one part of its climate action initiative, the  Singapore Green Plan 2030, which aims to build a sustainable city to ensure  that Singapore remains a clean and habitable place for all citizens.

Within that plan, the ESP focuses on making sustainability both  profitable and effective in reducing carbon emissions — beneficial for  businesses, investors, and the environment alike.

There are 3 major components to the programme:

1. Develop       sustainability capabilities in enterprises through training and support       for innovation
2. Strengthen       sector-specific capabilities through partnerships with Trade and       Association Chambers (TACs) and corporations
3. Foster       a vibrant and conducive sustainability ecosystem through partnerships with       service providers to strengthen training, certification, and financing

To encourage education, Enterprise Singapore co-funds 70% of the  course fees for participants, and these grants are available to any business  looking to innovate sustainably.

In these courses, participants will learn how to build  capabilities and capture opportunities in the green economy. If you are in  business in Singapore, you should definitely take advantage of this fantastic  opportunity to gain an edge in the market.

## The Fruits of Sustainable Innovation in  Singapore

It is one thing to praise policy, but it is another thing to show  what the fruits of that policy can look like.

Karana Foods, a Singapore company, produces plant-based meat  alternatives to popular animal-based meats like chicken satay and beef  rendang.

Jackfruit is being utilised as a meat replacement since it has a  similar texture when cooked.

Their innovation has vast implications on sustainability — by  replacing animal-based meat with plant-based meat, they are significantly  reducing the environmental impact of meat production.

Singapore’s first commercial “skyscraper farm” was launched  in 2016, producing about 500 kg  of produce per day.

Today, and &amp;ever, a German vertical farming company, is  establishing a plant and R&amp;D facility in Singapore, with a target output of  1,400kgs of vegetables and herbs each day.

These are real examples of innovation leading to product  development with sustainability in mind, and it is this kind of innovation that  the ESP is hoping to encourage more of.

## Sustainability in Singapore is Driving More Green Initiatives

Sustainable innovation is not a passing fad. It is here to stay,  and it is only going to become more important in the years to come.

The ESP is just one part of Singapore’s journey towards a more  sustainable future, and we can all be proud to be a part of it. For those still  on the fence, now is the time to jump in, with the generous support of the  Singapore Government.
