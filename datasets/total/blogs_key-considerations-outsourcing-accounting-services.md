As a business owner, outsourcing your accounting services provider is often the right step, but it also questions who you should employ. This significant decision requires a careful and thorough consideration of every aspect.

Some considerations to keep in mind when choosing a business accounting services provider in Singapore are the experience, reputation, and expertise of the company. Singapore is known for its dynamic and competitive market, making it essential to partner with a company with a proven track record of delivering quality services.

In this blog, we will discuss the key considerations to keep in mind when outsourcing your accounting services provider in Singapore.

## Determine Your Business Needs

Before initiating the search for an accounting services provider, you must pinpoint your business needs. This could range from basic bookkeeping, such as maintaining financial records, to more complex financial analysis and reporting.

Consider whether you require complementing services such as tax filing, payroll management, or auditing. Understanding these requirements will help you find a provider with the right expertise and ensure that the services rendered are tailored to meet your specific business objectives.

At InCorp, we are not just an accounting firm – we are a corporate services provider that offers a myriad of different services to help, such as:

- Accounting and bookkeeping services: This includes activities such as keeping accounting records to stay compliant with the requirements of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)
- Financial reporting: This encompasses general statements such as cash flow, financial position (also known as the balance sheet), and profit and loss statements
- Goods and Services Tax (GST), such as:
    - GST registration
    - GST submission and returns
    - GST audit
- Financial statements in XBRL: As Singapore moves towards adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), using XBRL in preparation of the financial accounts may be confusing for some businesses
- Drafting services for director’s report: We help companies in Singapore prepare and submit the Director’s Report as part of their statutory annual submission obligations
- Business support: We provide additional business support
- Audit liaison: An audit liaison acts as the link between a company and its external auditors during the audit process
- Payroll services: We have a reliable payroll system and professionals to handle your payroll timely for employee satisfaction and statutory compliance

## Consider Your Costs

It is critical to budget effectively for your accounting needs. When considering outsourcing, you should assess the initial costs and potential for long-term savings and value.

Compare the costs of in-house accounting personnel, including salaries, benefits, and technology investments, such as software, against the fixed or variable fees of outsourced accounting services.

It is important to look beyond price alone and evaluate the ROI in terms of expertise, efficiency improvements, and reduced errors. A reputable provider, such as InCorp, may offer scaleable services that can adapt to your company’s growth, thus offering a viable solution for immediate and future financial management needs.

## Know Your Provider’s Experience and Track Record

Evaluating the experience and track record of potential accounting service providers is paramount in ensuring that you entrust your financial processes to a reliable entity.

Seek companies with a proven history of success in your industry, as they are more likely to understand the specific challenges and regulatory requirements your business may face.

Inquire about their client portfolio, request case studies or testimonials, and consider how long they have been in operation. A provider’s longevity and client satisfaction are strong indicators of expertise and reliability.

Additionally, verify their staff qualifications and certifications to ensure they are equipped to handle your accounting needs comprehensively.

Some other potential questions you can ask are:

- Whether they have experience working with sizeable businesses in your industry
- Whether they have industry awards or the relevant certifications, such as a membership in the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA)

An experienced provider will understand and comply with the compliance guidelines under the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS).

## Why Choose an Accounting Service With Industry-Specific Expertise and Knowledge?

Selecting an accounting service with specialised expertise in your industry is crucial because it means they know the unique financial landscapes and challenges your business might face.

Providers with industry-specific knowledge can offer bespoke insights and solutions that generic accounting firms might overlook. They can also guide strategic financial planning, ensuring that your accounting practices are compliant and optimised for tax benefits and financial efficiency.

For instance, businesses in the manufacturing sector have significantly different accounting needs compared to those in the retail industry. An accounting firm experienced in manufacturing will be familiar with inventory management, cost of goods sold, and production overheads.

On the other hand, a firm specialising in retail can better handle point-of-sale (POS) system integrations, sales tax collection, and e-commerce revenue streams.

Therefore, it is not just about finding an accounting service but finding the right one versed in the complexities and nuances of your specific industry. This strategic alignment between your business needs and your provider’s expertise can significantly influence your company’s financial health and operational success.
