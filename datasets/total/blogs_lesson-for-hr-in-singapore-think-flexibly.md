# The 2022 Lesson for HR in Singapore: Think Flexibly

<!-- image -->

Human resources (HR) professionals worldwide have grappled with a  new reality post-COVID that has changed the dynamics of work.

For example, remote working became more widely accepted and  adopted as countries entered lockdowns during the initial stages of the  pandemic. Trends such as the Great Resignation and quiet quitting emerged in  the aftermath.

For talent-scarce Singapore, it is exceedingly important for HR  leaders to keep pace with the current state of work to keep their best workers  and attract new hires.

As the characteristics of the new workplace shift, here are some  lessons for HR in Singapore to remember in 2022:

## Flexible is the New Normal

There is no doubt about it – since the pandemic struck, many  workers have become used to working from home instead of the office.

Post-pandemic, hybrid work arrangements have been quickly gaining  popularity and precedence. Many employers have also become more open to  flexible work solutions, such as remote work.

Therefore, flexible work is quickly becoming the new normal and  may eventually become a key consideration for potential new hires.

HR managers need to work with their employers to establish new  strategies to manage hybrid employees to maintain engagement at work and  productivity.

## Reskilling and Upskilling as a Necessity

Today, reskilling and upskilling are viewed as necessary for  employees to prepare themselves for the future of work. Additionally, they can  benefit employers by improving employee retention, reducing training costs, and  increasing innovation.

Digital transformation is an enabler for these activities,  allowing employees to work remotely and offering opportunities to upskill  themselves.

HR leaders can be more proactive in helping their employees stay  abreast of the latest skills and trends. This can be done by providing training  opportunities, access to industry-specific certifications, and networking  events.

## Adopting Digital Tools

The pandemic has shifted many business processes online, so HR  professionals need to adapt and familiarise themselves with digital tools.

Today’s HR technology solutions revolve around digital platforms,  tools, software, and cloud-based technologies. Artificial intelligence and 5G  are expected to be key technological changes beyond 2022.

These technologies can automate daily processes, store essential  data securely, and offer analytical tools to derive insights to improve  decision-making.

Ultimately, they can save HR professionals time and money, improve  accuracy, limit liability, and boost productivity.

## Investment in Employee Welfare

Today’s employees treat welfare with more importance than ever.  This is particularly so as mental awareness increases and a greater emphasis is  placed on mental well-being.

Employers now need to focus on better supporting their employees  and creating an inclusive culture.

This includes offering adequate resources such as mentorship  programmes, health insurance coverage, and flexible working arrangements.

## The Continuous Pursuit of Work-Life Balance and Fulfilment

One of COVID-19’s lasting effects is how employees are putting  work-life balance and company values first.

Working from home has made many people prioritise these factors  and rethink their jobs by adding purpose and fulfilment into the mix.

One global trend reflects workers’ sentiments – termed the Great  Resignation, this movement has been in motion since 2021. From employees  belonging to the lower rungs to the higher-ups, the Great Resignation has  spared no one.

In fact, 80% of senior leaders surveyed consider quitting their  jobs in the next 2 years.

With new priorities, these workers leave in search of better job  opportunities with better work-life balance and culture.

Another phenomenon that has emerged is quiet quitting. This  involves employees rejecting the hustle culture deeply embedded within the  Asian workplace.

An example of quiet quitting is the refusal to carry out work  outside of an employee’s job scope or responsibilities in their  contracts.

It also reflects the desire to achieve a better work-life balance  as a response towards burnout worries.

## A Shift in Focus to Succeed for HR in Singapore

Businesses today must customise their workforce strategy to the  new needs of their employees to succeed over the long term.

Today’s employees are no longer just driven by salary –  progression opportunities, work-life balance, flexibility, and company values  also influence them.

Therefore, companies must think beyond salary figures, which is  not sustainable in the long run, and consider other employee needs like:

- Emotional       needs
- Physical       needs
- Mental       needs

Faced with a growing global talent shortage of skilled workers,  there is no better time to get started than now to attract and retain talent.
