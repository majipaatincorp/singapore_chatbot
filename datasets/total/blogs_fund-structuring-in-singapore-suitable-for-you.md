# Fund Structuring in Singapore: Is it Suitable For You?

<!-- image -->

As a fund manager or investor, one of your primary objectives is  achieving tax neutrality for your fund.

This means avoiding the imposition of taxes on income and gains and withholding taxes on profit repatriation and return of capital.

In the past, this has typically been achieved by setting up a fund  in a jurisdiction with a favourable tax regime or using a tax-transparent  structure.

However, the key considerations relating to funding formation have  evolved in recent years, with an increasing focus on ensuring that the fund  structure considers tax implications at the investment level.

The complexity of fund structuring can vary depending on the asset  class, with hedge funds typically having relatively simple structures.

On the other hand, funds investing in hard assets like real estate  and infrastructure tend to be more complex due to the various tax  considerations at different levels.

Let us look at why Singapore may be a suitable location for  setting up and structuring your fund, and what you will need to consider when  doing so.

## Why Choose Fund Structuring in Singapore?

There has been a trend towards onshoring funds in Singapore  recently, which can be attributed to several factors explored below:

- Cost-Competitiveness
Firstly, setting up and maintaining funds in traditional tax haven  countries like the Cayman Islands has become significantly more expensive due  to increased regulations.  
This makes it more cost-competitive to set up funds in  countries such as Singapore, which offer government-issued grants to  enhance attractiveness.
- The Shift Away From Traditional Fund  Structures
Secondly, institutional investors like sovereign wealth and  pension funds are increasingly moving away from traditional fund structures due  to potential reputational risks.  
Some family offices and ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs)  also avoid such structures due to the fear of being labelled as tax evaders.
- A Stable Political and Economic Landscape
Thirdly, some investors seek greater operational transparency  and control, which can be achieved through onshoring their funds.

By setting up funds in Singapore, investors can easily meet  their compliance obligations and access a network of financial services  professionals who are knowledgeable and experienced in the local  market.

Singapore has become a popular destination for fund managers due  to its stable political and economic environment, strong regulatory  framework and deep talent pool. It is also a major  financial hub in the Asia-Pacific region, with a network of over 90 double  taxation avoidance agreements.

These factors, along with the country’s attractive tax regime,  make it an appealing location for fund managers. Singapore’s corporate tax rate  is 17%, and there is no capital gains tax.

In addition, several tax incentives are available for  funds, including the Financial Sector Incentive–Fund Management (FSI-FM)  scheme. If you are a qualifying fund management company, you can enjoy a  concessionary tax rate of 10%.

## Considerations for Setting Up a Fund in Singapore

When considering whether to set up a fund in Singapore, there are  several main considerations to keep in mind.

### Legal Form

Firstly, you need to decide on the legal form of your fund. The  most common options for funds in Singapore are companies, including:

- Private
- Limited
- Trusts
- The       recent Singapore Variable Capital Company (VCC)
- Partnerships

Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the  best choice for your fund will depend on your specific circumstances and goals.

### Regulatory Environment

Next, you will need to consider the regulatory environment in  which your investment fund will operate.

Singapore has a well-established and respected regulatory  regime for fund management. Its asset management industry has become an  international hub for investors and fund managers.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulates the industry  with a risk-based approach. It means that the level of regulation is  proportionate to the risks a fund poses.

The regulatory framework in Singapore is designed to protect  investors’ interests and ensure the financial system’s integrity.

### Fund Taxation

Another key consideration is the taxation of your fund. As  mentioned earlier, Singapore has a favourable tax regime for funds, with a  corporate tax rate of 17% and no capital gains tax.

There are also several tax incentive schemes available for funds,  including the:

- FSI-FM       10% tax concession
- Enhanced-Tier       Fund Tax Incentive Scheme
- Singapore       Resident Fund Scheme, which provide for tax exemptions on certain income       or gains derived from the funds

In addition to these general considerations, you will also need to  consider your fund’s specific requirements, such as the type of assets it will  invest in and the investors it will target.

You may also consider fund governance, risk management and  investor protection issues.

## What is Next for Setting Up a Fund in Singapore?

Overall, Singapore is a highly attractive fund structuring  location for fund management companies and investors.

It has a stable political and economic environment, strong  regulatory framework, deep talent pool, and attractive tax regime.

It is also a major financial hub in the Asia-Pacific region, which  can be beneficial for fund managers looking to tap into the region’s growth.
