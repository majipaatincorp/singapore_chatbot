The global battle for talent has been a little more heated since  September 2022, with Malaysia announcing its Premium Visa Programme (PViP)  aimed at attracting "global tycoons".

But with 75% of companies reporting talent shortages, will  Malaysia’s salvo in the talent war be enough to best other direct  investment-focused visas like Singapore’s ONE Pass?

Let  us look at each visa and see what they offer, how they differ, and which is the  best choice for top-performing expats.

## ONE Pass Singapore: What is the Overseas  Networks and Expertise Pass About?

Singapore announced a new pass, the Overseas  Networks and Expertise (ONE) Pass, in  August 2022, which became active on Jan 1, 2023.

It is designed to be Singapore’s most adaptable working visa in  its history, focusing on attracting top-tier global talent to the Lion  City.

One big attraction of the ONE Pass for expats is that they are not  required to find employment immediately, allowing them to take time to find  the ideal opportunity.

Once they find their ideal position, they are also free to work  for multiple companies simultaneously, greatly expanding their options.

ONE Pass holders can also start their own businesses, even if another company already employs them.

This contrasts with other Singapore working visas like the Employment  Pass (EP) and Personalised Employment Pass (PEP), which have more restrictions  on entrepreneurship.

Crucially, a ONE Pass holder can sponsor their children, and their spouses will be allowed to work upon obtaining a Letter of Consent (LOC).

Singapore’s ONE Pass is a 5-year visa, which again, holds  advantages over the Employment Pass (EP) and Personalised Employment Pass  (PEP), which are only valid for 2 and 3 years, respectively.

The pass can then be extended to a further 5 years if  certain criteria are met.

To obtain these attractive benefits, applicants must be confident  of their credentials, as the barriers to entry are significantly higher than  Singapore’s lesser working visas.

The ONE Pass is targeted at high-income earners with a  fixed monthly salary of US$22,000 monthly or US$262,000 annually.

Candidates who are existing work pass holders also need to prove  that they have been working for at least 1 year in Singapore, or will be  working for an established company in the country.

Overseas candidates also need to show that they have been working  for at least 1 year for a reputable company overseas, or will be doing so in  Singapore.

Applicants with outstanding achievements in research and  academia, science and technology, sports, or arts and culture are also  considered even if they do not meet the salary criterion.

## What is Malaysia’s Premium Visa Programme (PViP)  About?

The Malaysia Premium Visa Programme (PViP) is a long-term  residency visa that enables foreign talent to live in Malaysia for up to 20  years.

The Malaysian Government introduced it on Sept 1, 2022, to attract  wealthy foreigners to invest in Malaysia and drive its economic growth.

The PViP will allow holders to study, work, invest (in approved  sectors), and run one or more businesses in Malaysia. It also allows  sponsoring dependants, such as your spouse and children under 21 but there are  fees attached as mentioned below.

The visa is valid for up to 20 years. Despite this long visa  length, it must be renewed every five years; technically, five years is  the longest validity for a Malaysian working visa.

While the required income is lower than the ONE Pass, the overall  entry requirements are more involved than the ONE Pass.

Applicants must earn an offshore income of at least US$9,000  monthly or US$107,000 annually.

However, to sponsor dependants, applicants must also pay one-off participation fees of US$45,000 for themselves and US$24,000 for each  dependent.

Applicants must also open a fixed deposit account of US$224,000  with a licensed bank in Malaysia. They may withdraw up to half of that  amount after one year to invest in the Malaysian economy.

## Singapore’s ONE Pass vs Malaysia’s PViP: Which  is Better?

Both visas will appeal to expats, but which is the better choice?  Ultimately, it depends on your employee’s circumstances and needs.

If an applicant is a high-income earner looking to  establish roots with their family and have as much economic freedom as  possible, the ONE Pass might be a better fit.

As long as they can meet the criteria, it offers more flexibility  than the PViP in terms of its multiple-employer option and entrepreneurial  scope.

On the other hand, if applicants are looking to make a 20-year  commitment to Malaysia’s economy or start their own business while having the  ability to study, then the PViP may be a better choice.

The entry requirements have a lower income threshold, but be aware  of other requirements, like paying for dependents and making significant  deposits into Malaysian bank accounts.

Ultimately, the utmost concern for most prospective talent will  likely be political stability and access to a mature, robust economy with  endless prospects of building a life.

In this regard, Singapore is superior to Malaysia in many ways, so  the PViP might not be sufficient enough to attract professionals when they can  have a better overall experience in Singapore.
