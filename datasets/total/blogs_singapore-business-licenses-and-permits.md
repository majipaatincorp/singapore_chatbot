## Approvals, Business Licenses and Permits for Singapore Companies

Depending on the type of business you would like set up in Singapore, it is sometimes necessary to obtain a license and/or permit when you register your business with Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA). ACRA’s automated system will indicate if another approving authority is required to grant a business license or permit during the application for name approval.

Although most companies do not require business licenses or permits to operate, there are a handful that do as they are regulated by the approving authorities. Some of these are private schools, travel agencies, liquor distributors, moneylenders, banks, childcare centres, importers/exporters, wholesalers and retailers of liquors.

InCorp can assist and advise on this matter for an additional fee should the need arise. Please email us at info@incorp.asia or call us at +65 63201888, should you need any further assistance.
