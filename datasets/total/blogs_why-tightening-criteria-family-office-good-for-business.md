# Why The Tightening Criteria for Family Offices is Good for Singapore

With Asia’s billionaire population increasing by 16.5 percent last year, the continent is now home to over a quarter of the world’s ultra-rich. If this trend continues, that number is projected to account for a third of the world’s billionaires by 2023.

This explosive growth has spurred a wealth of investment opportunities for Asian families. In order to preserve their wealth, these families have created a bloom of Single-Family Offices in the region to manage their wealth.

This already large yet rapidly expanding industry has been a key focus for the Singapore Government over the last decade, rightly seeing it as a major business opportunity and doing whatever it can to attract the region’s wealthy to set up family offices here. To maintain its attractiveness, Singapore boasts some of the most tax-friendly incentives in the world.

## Fund Tax Incentives

To assist family offices in managing their wealth funds, the Singapore Government provides several tax incentives, which can exempt a broad range of investment gains. Unlike other jurisdictions, the Government also concessionary exempts single family offices from licensing requirements

The combination of exemption from a Capital Markets Services License and tax incentive allows a Singapore-based family office to be tax efficient with minimal regulatory obligation.

## New 2023 Criteria (Updated 5th July 2023)

In order to ensure that the Family Offices started in Singapore are of the highest standards, the government maintains a comprehensive set of criteria to ensure that the above tax incentives are only granted to funds that demonstrate they are sound, credible, and robust.

Recently, Singapore’s Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) imposed new and stricter conditions for single family offices looking to tap on the 13O and 13U tax incentive schemes to refresh the criteria and address the current economic outlook. The new conditions are outlined in the following table:

## How Will This Impact Funds in Singapore?

These new conditions are stricter compared to previous standards set for Single family offices offices. At a surface level, this may appear to go against Singapore’s long-standing business-friendly stature.

While these conditions may appear harsher, this is far from the case. The Family Office industry has grown and expanded rapidly since 2019. Singapore has become the preferred base for high net worth individuals (HNWIs) to set up family offices. Singapore’s banking and finance sector has long been globally recognized as one of the best in the world, and measures must be taken to ensure that funds approved to operate in Singapore are of the highest standard, so that Singapore can continue to enjoy this well-deserved status.

Eric Chin, InCorp Global’s Chief Business Development officer, believes this is a masterstroke by the Singapore Government:

The refreshed conditions for SFOs is a way for the Singapore government to ensure that HNW families that enjoy the SFO tax incentives in the country create long-term substance and economic benefits that can bring about employment of locals and increase investment activities for Singapore companies. The newly added conditions to count donations into Singapore registered charities and grants given to blended finance structures to help SFOs meet minimum business spending conditions are much welcomed, this widens the ways SFOs can bring about benefits for Singapore on a more wholesome basis.

Regardless of your views on these new regulations, they only serve to protect consumers by ensuring that the funds operating in Singapore are of the highest standard.
