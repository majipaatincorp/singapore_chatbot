## Why PEO services is essential in the new normal

In uncertain times especially during this global COVID-19 pandemic, businesses are severely affected on all fronts and thus have to maximise resource efficiency. For foreign companies looking to expand into Singapore for the first time, besides investing resources into setting up a new company and hiring employees under the new company, there is another option of using PEO services in Singapore for an interim period prior to setting up a new company first.

Our PEO services facilitate and support your company’s manpower operations by allowing you to access our highly qualified, experienced, and capable accounting, finance, business consulting, business development professionals without the hassle of hiring a full-time staff.

To expand globally, businesses can work with an Employer of Record (EOR) or Professional Employer Organization (PEO) like InCorp to take on all aspects of employment, including HR Compliance, Payroll, Taxes, and other benefits.
