**How often do I need to file GST returns?**
If your company is GST-registered (mandatory when annual turnover exceeds S$1 million), you must file GST returns quarterly. The filing and payment are due within one month after the end of each quarter. Our team can assist with GST registration and compliance.

**What is the corporate tax rate in Singapore?**
Singapore's corporate tax rate is 17% on chargeable income. However, there are various tax incentives available, including tax exemption schemes for new start-up companies and partial tax exemption for established companies on their first S$200,000 of chargeable income.

Late filing may result in penalties ranging from S$200 to S$1,000 and could lead to court summons. Timely submission is crucial, and we can help ensure all deadlines are met effectively.

# Virtual Office Services/PEO/EOR/Payroll Services

**What is a Virtual Office, and how can it help my business?**

A Virtual Office provides a registered business address without the need for a physical office. It offers benefits like:

- Reducing overhead costs.
- Managing your mail and correspondence.

Our Virtual Office services ensure your business stays professional and organized.

**How does Professional Employer Organization (PEO) service work in Singapore?**
PEO services allow companies to hire employees in Singapore without establishing a legal entity. The PEO becomes the legal employer of record, handling payroll, benefits administration, and HR compliance while you maintain day-to-day management of employees.

Outsourcing payroll ensures compliance with Singapore's employment laws, accurate CPF contributions, timely salary disbursement, and proper maintenance of payroll records. It reduces administrative burden and minimizes compliance risks while providing confidentiality in salary matters.

We can recommend the best option based on your business needs.

# Non-Resident Company Setup

Foreign companies can establish a presence in Singapore through a subsidiary company, branch office, or representative office. Each structure has different requirements and implications for tax and liability.

**Do I need to be physically present in Singapore to set up a company?**
No, you don't need to be physically present in Singapore to set up a company. The registration process can be handled remotely with proper documentation and authorized representatives. However, you'll need a local resident director.

**What are the main types of business entities available in Singapore?**
The main business entities in Singapore include Private Limited Companies, Sole Proprietorships, Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP), and Branch Offices. Each structure has different registration requirements, liability protection, and tax implications.

**What is the difference between a Branch Office and a Subsidiary?**
A branch office is an extension of the foreign company and not a separate legal entity, meaning the foreign company bears full liability. A subsidiary is a separate legal entity with limited liability protection, offering more flexibility in operations and local tax benefits.

**Which business structure offers the best liability protection?**
A Private Limited Company offers the best liability protection as it's a separate legal entity from its shareholders. Shareholders' liability is limited to their capital contribution, protecting personal assets from business debts and liabilities.

**What are the advantages of setting up a Private Limited Company in Singapore?**

A Private Limited Company offers:
