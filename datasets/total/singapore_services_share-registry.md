## What is a Share Registry in Singapore?

A share registry in Singapore is an ongoing-updated list of active (current) shareholders of a company, which includes each person’s (or entity’s) name, physical address, and the number of shares owned. Sometimes, the registry can hold details of every share transaction (with pricing details) going back to over 10 years, any restrictions on share transfers, as well as the details of each shareholder’s occupation and the price they paid per share.
